--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.6.0 (Feburary 26 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
Smart Game Format (SGF) data processing:
- Added an SGF parser (#112). Little Go can now read and write SGF data on its
  own without having to delegate this task to Fuego (the built-in computer
  player library). The core piece of software is SGFC, the SGF Syntax Checker &
  Converter. A big thank you to Arno Hollosi for writing this tool and making it
  available under a free license, and also for helping with integrating it into
  Little Go.
- When you select an SGF file in the archive you can now see if the file
  contains more than just one game. For each game you now get a preview of its
  content and you can select which game to load (#338).
- In the Settings screen there are now a number of user preferences that give
  you some control over how SGF files are processed (#337). The defaults should
  be fine, especially for files that were created by Little Go, but if you have
  imported files from an external source you might need to make adjustments.
  The in-game manual has all the details.

Other features:
- Added a new user preference to the "Board position" settings screen that lets
  you choose whether discarding the computer player's last move also discards
  your own last move (#99). The goal is that if the option is enabled you can
  immediately play again after a discard and try out a different move.
- Added a new entry to the "More game actions" menu that lets you play a rematch
  without showing the "New game" screen first (#313). This is a convenient
  shortcut to quickly start a new game with the same parameters as the last one.
- Added a new user preference that lets you choose what kind of computer
  assistance you would like to receive. The default is, just like before, to let
  the computer make a move on your behalf. What's new is that if you prefer you
  can now tell the computer to instead only make a suggestion how to play (#28).
  Note that the feature is still a bit rough on the edges. Known issues have
  been collected in #363, the polish will come in one of the next releases.

========================
Improvements and changes
========================
- The buttons that let the user navigate between board positions have now more
  space between them (#346), making it less likely that the user taps the wrong
  button. Thanks to Dan Hassin for both reporting the issue and implementing the
  fix.
- Loading a game from the archive now benefits from improved error handling.
  If a game cannot be loaded you will now get better error messages that should
  be more helpful.
- When a game is saved to the archive the current player names are now written
  to the SGF data (#237).
- The user interface has been adapted to newer iOS devices with a sensor notch,
  rounded corners and/or a Home indicator instead of a Home button (#336).
- The app now supports Dark Mode (#345). A new, darker wooden background for
  the board still needs to be found (#360).
- When Little Go is newly installed from the App Store the default computer
  player is now weaker (#358). This should give more users a positive first
  app experience. Users who want a challenge can still increase the difficulty
  by switching to a stronger computer player. A side effect of this change is
  that the default computer player no longer uses the "Pondering" setting, which
  means that the iOS device's battery should now be used up a lot less.
- Added another predefined computer player that has "Pondering" disabled. Users
  who already have the app installed need to select "Reset to defaults" in the
  "Players" settings screen to see the new player.
- The app's user interface no longer exposes GTP engine profiles as a separate
  entity, instead the user interface now only displays players (#211). It should
  now be easier for users to find the settings for adjusting the computer
  player's strength.

========
Bugfixes
========
- The app no longer crashes when a game with many moves (500 or more) is
  archived or unarchived (#357).
- The app no longer crashes when a game is loaded while an ended game with
  non-alternating dispute resolution is present (#361).
- Speculative fix for a potential app crash when an SGF file is imported (#362).
- The information which player resigned is no longer lost when the user switches
  to an earlier board position (#341).
- On iPhone devices with larger displays, when the device is rotated while the
  activity indicator is displayed in the status view the activity indicator is
  now still displayed after the rotation (#343).

===========
Regressions
===========
- All iPhones: When board setup mode was added in version 1.5.0 a bug was
  introduced that made it possible for board position lists to show erroneous
  information when moves were discarded and then replayed, or when games were
  restarted with different characteristics. This bug has now been fixed (#359).
- iPhone devices with smaller displays: When iOS 13 or newer was installed on
  these devices the current board position view stopped responding to taps.
  This bug has now been fixed (#344).

=================
Technical changes
=================
- The project has been upgraded to the iOS 14.3 SDK (#335) and
  Xcode 12.3 (#334).
- The migration from Twitter Fabric to Google Firebase is now complete (#322).
- Support for iOS 8 has been dropped, the minimum required version is now iOS
  9.0 (#305). This should not affect any devices unless they are artificially
  held back at iOS 8.
- The project's software build should now work out of the box for new
  contributors. Thanks to Dan Hassin for contributing the necessary changes.

Version 1.5.0 (March 20 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- Added a board setup mode (#276). When you start a new game, instead of
  beginning to play you can now switch to board setup mode. In this mode you can
  place black or white stones in any order and combination to set up the initial
  board before you begin to play moves. In addition to placing stones, you can
  select the side which is to play the first move. Read the "Board setup"
  section in the in-game manual for a detailed feature description.

========
Bugfixes
========
- Fixed a bug in Fuego that could cause Fuego to play a stone during the opening
  game on an intersection that was already occupied by a handicap or setup
  stone (#328). In addition, Little Go's error handling is now capable of
  dealing with such a situation so that user's are not stuck in a seemingly
  endless "computer is thinking" loop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.0 (January 13 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==========
Known bugs
==========
- On iPhone Plus devices as well as on iPhone XS Max, when the user navigates
  to the first or last board position most of the time the new current board
  position is not displayed with a special background color as it should
  (#326).

========
Features
========
- Added support for loading and saving .sgf files that contain stone and/or
  player setup nodes (#323). This kind of .sgf files is frequently used for
  sharing board positions that teach how to play best in certain game
  situations, or that are puzzles to be solved. Notes:
  - It was already possible to load these .sgf files before the change, but
    Little Go would not display the stones specified by the stone setup nodes,
    and playing after loading such an .sgf file would usually result in the
    alert message "Your move was rejected by Fuego".
  - Even after this change, only those .sgf files are properly handled which
    contain setup nodes at the beginning of the file. Little Go still cannot
    properly handle .sgf file that contain setup nodes after the first move is
    played.

========================
Improvements and changes
========================
- The "New game" screen now displays a recommendation to use the area scoring
  system.
- The "Game info" screen now shows stone and player setup information.
- When the app is started for the first time after the update, two new
  GTP commands "list_setup" and "list_setup_player" are added to the user's
  list of GTP commands (Diagnostics > GTP commands).
- The way how an archived game can be shared was re-implemented
  (UIActivityViewController instead of the long deprecated
  UIDocumentInteractionController). This may result in users now seeing
  different sharing options.
- The Changelog is now available in-app

========
Bugfixes
========
- When playing with area scoring, the Fuego computer player now correctly
  includes handicap compensation in its score calculation (#319). Before this
  fix, the Fuego computer player was calculating scores without handicap
  compensation, which would lead to it resigning (when playing as white) even
  though it had actually won the game. Or it might not resign (when playing
  as black) even though it had actually lost the game. This serious bug was
  reported by dtsudo - thanks a lot!
- The app now synchronizes komi with Fuego when board positions are changed
  (#324). Up until now the app never synchronized komi. This omission could
  lead to the following problems:
  - An .sgf file is saved with the wrong komi value in it.
  - Fuego is likely to play wrong moves. For instance, towards the end of the
    game Fuego might start to pass because it thinks it is winning, or it
    might resign because it thinks it is losing. The probability of misplays
    increases when there is a large difference in komi values.
  These problems would occur only if the user loaded an .sgf file that
  contained a different komi value than the last game that was started with
  the "New game" function, and then changed board positions or discarded a
  move.
- A bug in the board drawing routines was fixed which caused the app to
  occasionally crash (#308).

===========
Regressions
===========
- White player influence is now shown correctly with white squares (#317).
  White player influence was erroneously shown with black squares since the
  release of version 1.1.0. Thanks for reporting this bug go to ecru86.
- Users that do not have automatic crash reporting enabled are now asked
  whether they want to submit a crash report (#321). The alert that asks for
  permission was accidentally disabled since the release of version 1.3.0.
  Because the alert was disabled, no crash reports were submitted at all
  unless the user had automatic crash reporting enabled.

=================
Technical changes
=================
- The project has been upgraded to the iOS 12.1 SDK (#314) and
  Xcode 10.1 (#315)
- Code signing overhaul: Code signing is now managed automatically by Xcode
- The project is now built with Bitcode enabled (#295)
- The project now uses libc++ (#181), the C++ standard library implementation
  provided by the LLVM project, instead of libstdc++, the GNU project's
  implementation.
- Communication between Little Go and Fuego is no longer based on named pipes,
  instead it works with a custom stream buffer that acts as an in-memory pipe
  (#316). This change was necessary because libc++ has a bug [1] that breaks
  the original named pipe communication channel.
  [1] https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23078
- Started migration from Twitter Fabric to Google Firebase (#320). A best
  effort has been made to disable all other Google services and to only keep
  Crashlytics enabled. Notably, Firebase Analytics data collection has been
  explicitly disabled! An explanatory side note: This technical change has
  become necessary because in January 2017 Google acquired Fabric/Crashlytics
  and, after a grace period of 1.5 years, announced in September 2018 that
  they will discontinue Fabric in favour of the Firebase platform. It's all
  very complicated, but the main point is that Little Go wants to continue to
  use the excellent Crashlytics as its crash reporting service, and since that
  now requires integration with the Firebase platform, Little Go has no choice
  but to follow Google's lead.
- All third party software has been upgraded to their newest versions
  (Boost 1.69.0, CocoaPods 1.5.3, MBProgressHUD 1.1.0, Cocoa Lumberjack 3.4.2,
  Fabric 1.6.13, Crashlytics 3.8.6)

Bugfixes
========
- Another ko detection problem when viewing an old board position is now
  fixed (#307). This was the root cause for the dreaded alert message
  "Your move was rejected by Fuego", which must have popped up on quite a few
  people's devices, but which I had never been able to reproduce despite the
  bug reports that were kindly sent to me by some of the most patient users.
  Yesterday, however, I received a report that finally gave me a reproducible
  case which allowed me to pinpoint and fix the coding error. Many thanks to
  everybody who sent bug reports, but especially to Manuel Braun for
  submitting the crucial last bug report.

Version 1.3.0 (September 12 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- iPad Pro is now supported with its native screen resolution (#297)

========================
Improvements and changes
========================
- When the game is resumed to settle a life & death dispute, a "Resume Play"
  alert is displayed if the game rules allow resumption with non-alternating
  play. Previously the alert buttons were sometimes displayed in the order
  Black/White and someteimes in the order White/Black, depending on whose
  player's turn it was. Now the alert buttons are always displayed in the
  order Black/White (#300)

========
Bugfixes
========
- Ko detection now works correctly if an old board position is viewed (#289).
  Many thanks to Denis Martynov for bringing this to my attention. I promised
  to release the bugfix "as soon as possible, probably next weekend". This was
  in June 2015 - over a year ago :-(
- The status view now displays the correct text after the user discards all
  moves at the beginning of a game (#301)
- iPhone n Plus devices: The "Game Info" and "More Game Actions" buttons are
  now correctly enabled after rotating the device to landscape (#299)

- The project now uses CocoaPods for most 3rdparty libraries (#291)
- The 3rd party crash reporting library QuincyKit was replaced by a new
  library called Crashlytics (#293)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.0 (June 12 2015)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- iPhone 6/6+ are now supported with their native screen resolution (#263)
- iPhone 6+ has a redesigned user interface that makes better use of the
  available screen estate (#253). iPhone 6+ also supports holding the device
  in landscape.
- When starting a new game, it is now possible to select from several
  predefined rulesets, which allows setting many game rules at once with a
  single tap (#274). This makes the "New game" screen less cluttered and more
  user friendly. Rule enthusiasts can still adjust each individual game rule
  by calling up an "Advanced settings" screen.
- Gameplay mechanics at the end of the game have been significantly revised:
  - It is now generally possible to resume play after two pass moves without
    having to discard ("undo") the second pass move
  - 3 new game rules were added that govern gameplay mechanics at the end of
    the game. These rules allow to play games under AGA or IGS rules
    (#221, #223), but also under Japanese and Chinese rules where
    non-alternating play is possible to resume a game after it has ended after
    two pass moves (#275).
- As a consequence of these new gameplay mechanics at the end of the game, a
  much wider array of .sgf files can now be loaded from the archive, provided
  that the user selects the appropriate rules for the game that is in the .sgf
  file.
  - Files that contain more than two pass moves at the end of the game. This
    is especially useful to load games that were played on IGS (Pandanet),
    where games end with 3 instead of 2 pass moves.
  - Files that resume play after two pass moves. Again, this is useful for
    loading files from IGS (Pandanet), but also for files that contain games
    played under any ruleset that allows play to be resumed after two pass
    moves.
  - Files that contain non-alternating play (e.g. two moves in a row by
    black). This is useful to load files that contain game problems where
    theoretical board situations are set up by non-alternating play. Also,
    games can now be loaded that were played under rulesets (e.g. Chinese,
    Japanese) that allow play to be resumed after two pass moves by
    non-alternating play.
- Special thanks go to Norbert Langermann and his innocent suggestion to add
  support for loading .sgf files with games that were played on IGS. This was
  the trigger for adding the new end-of-game gameplay mechanics.
- One more thing: When placing a stone a magnifying glass is now displayed
  that shows the area of the board that currently under the user's 'fingertip
  (#271). This feature replaces the old "stone distance from fingertip"
  feature, which confused and was hated by many users.

========================
Improvements and changes
========================
- Disable Fuego pondering in human vs. human games (#281). This saves *a lot*
  of otherwise wasted battery power. Thanks to Ben Jackson for the suggestion.
  Unfortunately, a nasty piece of code was required to upgrade existing user
  preferences, which may result in unnecessary player and profile backup
  copies cluttering the upgraded preferences. Users will get an alert if this
  happens so that they can clean up their preferences.
- When a game cannot be loaded from the archive because it has moves after
  the game has ended, the error message displayed to the user should now be
  less cryptic (#277)
- When the game has ended, the "Scoring" menu item is now shown as a button
  so that the user can quickly switch between scoring mode and play mode
  without first having to call up the "More game actions" menu (#268)
- A couple of buttons have gotten new icons (#269). Thanks to David Helfand
  for the suggestion.
- The status view now always shows the status for the current and the next
  board position (#265). Up until now the status view only showed when a
  player had passed, and never showed any information about the next board
  position.

========
Bugfixes
========
- The app now correctly synchronizes handicap stones with Fuego when board
  positions are changed (#279). This is the most important bugfix of this
  release because it fixes another source for the infamous
  "The computer played an illegal move" and "Your move was rejected by Fuego"
  alerts. Many thanks to Laurent Guanzini for providing step-by-step
  instructions that helped me with diagnosing the problem!
- The app no longer crashes when a game is loaded from the archive that
  contains a board that is larger than 19x19 (#283). The game still cannot be
  loaded, but an error message is displayed instead of crashing.
- The app no longer crashes when the last game in the archive is deleted
  (#286)
- It is now possible to place a stone when viewing an old board position, even
  if the game has already ended (#278). It is thus possible to resume play at
  an earlier board position than the last.
- The user interface no longer rotates while a stone is being placed (#272)
- The status view now correctly displays "<color> passed" when a computer vs.
  computer game is paused (#266)
- If the user attempts to make an illegal move, the status view now displays
  the intersection of the move (#261)
- The device statusbar at the top of the screen no longer disappears when
  some screens are displayed (#256)
- iPad only: The board is now rotated correctly even if it is not visible at
  the time that the device orientation changes (#255)
- A number of other bugs were fixed that may have caused crashes (#192, #284)
- Other minor bugfixes (#209, #257, #258, #262, #273)

Version 1.1.2 (September 19 2014)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Bugfixes
========
- Interactive UI elements are now disabled while a stone-placing gesture is in
  progress (#243). This closes a loop hole that may have been the source for
  a number of crashes in the past (e.g. the crash described in #244)
- Stones no longer temporarily disappear from view while dragging a new stone
  (#245). Thanks to stfiend for reporting this bug.
- Fixed a potential crash if the computer player starts playing immediately
  after a game is loaded from the archive (#247).

===========
Regressions
===========
- It is now possible again to make a move when viewing an old board position
  while the game has already ended (#246). This will resume the game, discard
  all board positions beyond the one that the user is currently viewing, and
  then play the desired move.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.1 (August 15 2014)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Bugfixes
========
- App (hopefully) no longer crashes while stone is dragged around the board
  (#242)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.0 (August 10 2014)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================
Improvements and changes
========================
- The app's user interface has been updated to the iOS 7 look & feel (#204)
- The "maximum zoom" user preference has been removed (#217)
- iPad: The "Game Actions" menu is now displayed in a popover (#232)
- The name of the "iPhone 4S" demo profile has been changed to "Strong" (#210)
- The "long press" gesture for placing a stone now has a slightly longer
  delay (#241). This should make it less likely that the user places a stone
  when instead she wanted to scroll.

========
Bugfixes
========
- Drawing for Retina displays has been fixed (#205). Many thanks to
  Eric O. Lebigot for reporting the issue and giving me the necessary KITB to
  investigate the problem.
- The app no longer crashes when the "Score" segment is visible on the
  "Game Info" screen and player/profile information is edited (#225)
- The app no longer crashes when a player is viewed on the "Game" segment of
  the "Game Info" screen and the game ends (#226)
- The app no longer crashes when a saved game is renamed and the new name
  contains illegal characters (#235)
- iPad: The list of board positions now shows the correct move after
  discard & play (#233)
- iPhone: Potential app crash eliminated if user taps an entry in the list of
  board positions (#229)
- Handicap compensation is now shown in the "Game info" screen even if scoring
  mode is not enabled (#220)
- The "Minimum number of games" setting in the resign behaviour advanced
  settings screen is no longer editable if the "Auto-select" setting is turned
  on (#207)
- When the board is zoomed in or out, the internally managed zoom scale can no
  longer become lower/higher than the intended minimum/maximum (#139)

===========
Regressions
===========
- The "Load" button on the Archive tab is now disabled again while the
  computer is thinking (#227). This was broken when document interaction was
  introduced in 0.11.0.

=================
Technical changes
=================
- Memory usage during zooming has been greatly reduced (#212, #214, #215)
- Memory usage for wooden background image has been reduced (#216)
- The project has been upgraded to the iOS 7 SDK (#204) and Xcode Xcode 5.1.1
- Support for iOS 6 has been dropped, the minimum required version is now iOS
  7.0. Devices that are no longer supported are the iPhone 3GS and the
  iPod Touch 4th generation.
- The user interface now uses Auto Layout instead of manually calculated
  frames (#206)
- Unit tests were migrated from SenTestingKit/OCUnit to XCTest (#222)
- No longer use any .xib files, the entire UI is now set up programmatically

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (January 06 2014)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- When a new game is started, it is now possible to select one of several ko
  rules. Simple ko remains the default, new choices are positional and
  situational superko (#169).
- When a new game is started, it is now possible to select whether area or
  territory scoring should be in effect (#30). Area scoring is the default
  because the computer player (Fuego) does not properly support territory
  scoring.
- During scoring it is now possible to mark stones in seki (#190). Tap the
  "Actions" button to find the menu entry that lets you switch from
  "mark dead stones" to "mark stones in seki".
- It is now possible to display player influence, aka territory statistics,
  for an estimate who owns an area (#18). The feature can be enabled under
  "Settings > Display > Display player influence".

==============================
Other improvements and changes
==============================
- Some of the sections on the "Settings" tab have been re-organized (#132)
- Attempting to play an illegal move now displays the reason why the move is
  illegal (#182). Examples are suicide, ko or superko.
- When a new game is started and a handicap is selected, komi is adjusted
  automatically to 0.5 (#189)
- The computer player's strength has improved because a new version of Fuego
  has been integrated into Little Go. It is not possible to quantify the
  improvement against human opponents, but if the new and the old versions of
  Fuego play against each other, the new version wins 80% - 90% of the games.
- Use pattern-based additive knowledge on devices with more than 512 MB memory
  (#187).

========
Bugfixes
========
- iOS 7: The app no longer crashes on startup after a game has been imported
  from an external app such as Mail or DropBox (#184)
- The app no longer crashes when game is loaded while "Game Info" screen is
  displayed (#191)
- The app no longer hangs after launch if it was previously suspended/killed
  during scoring (#203)
- The maximum zoom scale has been reduced to 2.0 for iPad devices, and to 2.5
  for iPhone devices (#202). The previous maximum zoom scale 3.0 was too high,
  causing crashes on most devices.
- The next stone marker "A" is no longer displayed after all moves have been
  discarded (#200)
- The "Start of the game" board position table view cell no longer has a wrong
  background color (#199)
- The "Delete all games" button on the "Archive" tab is no longer affected by
  edit mode (#185)
- A sliding gesture no longer puts the entire "Players & Profiles" screen into
  edit mode (#175)
- A number of memory leaks were fixed (#188 and other, smaller fixes)

=================
Technical changes
=================
- The project has been upgraded to Xcode 5.0 (#183)
- Support for iOS 5 has been dropped, the minimum required version is now
  iOS 6.1 (#198). Devices that are no longer supported are iPad 1st generation
  and iPod Touch 3rd generation.
- The 3rd party software build process has been completely rewritten (#92)
- All 3rd party software have been upgraded to newest versions
  (Fuego trunk r1728, Boost 1.55.0, MBProgressHUD 0.8, Cocoa Lumberjack 1.7.0,
  ZipKit 1.0.2, QuincyKit 2.1.9)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.12.0 (September 09 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- It is now possible to configure the computer player with a threshold how
  quickly it will resign a game (#133). For instance, it is now possible to
  tell the computer player to never resign so that the game can be played out
  to the very end. This also allows beginners to play with a large handicap on
  a small board (up until now the computer player would always resign
  immediately when faced with an overwhelming handicap). The resignation
  behaviour setting can be found towards the bottom on the "edit profile"
  screen.
- When an old board position is viewed, the intersection where the next stone
  will be placed is now marked with the letter "A" (#101). This can be
  disabled in the "Board position" settings.
- Changes to the active profile are now immediately applied to the GTP engine
  (#123). For instance, it is now possible to change the playing strength or
  the resign behaviour of the computer player without starting a new game.
- At the bottom of the "Archive" tab there is now a button to delete all
  archived games in one fell swoop (#55)
- The tab order can now be customized (#57)
- Players & profiles can now be reset to their factory defaults (#54), in case
  some severe misconfiguration occurred
- Players & profiles can now be edited directly from the Game Info screen
  (#122)

==============================
Other improvements and changes
==============================
- Loading a game from the archive is now about 10% faster (#166)
- The user interface for changing the dangerous "Max. memory" profile setting
  is now vastly improved (#153). The maximum value that can be selected for
  the setting is now limited to a fraction of the device's physical memory,
  and the amount of physical memory that the device has is also displayed.
- When a computer player is edited, there is now a button that allows to
  directly edit the profile that the player is using (#71)
- When a profile is edited, the players that are using the profile are now
  listed at the bottom of the screen (#70)
- The button to reset predefined GTP commands is now clearly marked with a
  "red warning" style (#56)
- The "About" screen now displays the build date/time (#161)

========
Bugfixes
========
- The GTP engine is configured to no longer recognize positional superko
  (#171). This is a temporary solution to bring the GTP engine's rules into
  sync with Little Go's rules. Little Go currently does not recognize superko,
  so this sync'ing fixes the problem that Little Go lets the user make a
  superko move which is then rejected by the GTP engine. Many thanks to Brid
  Griffin for emailing me a bug report that helped me with diagnosing this
  problem! Note that Little Go will officially support superko in 1.0.
- On the iPad, the board size is now correct after the device is rotated while
  the board is zoomed (#162)
- Dragging a stone outside the zoomed in board section no longer places the
  stone (#143)
- The computer player now resigns even if the profile setting "Max. games" is
  set to a value < 5000 (#154)
- Undo resign is no longer possible when viewing an old board position. This
  fixes the problem that undo resign when viewing an old board position
  corrupts the backup .sgf (#158).
- If the game has ended but an old board position is viewed, the status view
  now shows information related to the board position instead of end-of-game
  information (#107)
- Scoring mode is no longer activated automatically when a player resigns. The
  effect is that the status now reads "x has resigned" instead of the
  inappropriate "y wins by ..." (#4). If a score is desired it must be
  requested by manually activating scoring mode.
- The user can no longer place a stone on behalf of the computer player (#160)
- The board position can no longer be changed while Fuego is searching for
  an initial set of dead stones during scoring (#163)
- A number of potential app crashes have been eliminated (#130, #172, #173)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.11.1 (May 20 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Bugfixes
========
- Board position can no longer be changed while other commands are executed
  (#156). This hard-to-find bug caused numerous crashes (e.g. those described
  by issues #128 and #129) and other problems, such as the infamous
  "The computer played an illegal move." alert. Many thanks to Logan Bouia and
  Carole Wolf for emailing me bug reports that helped me with diagnosing the
  problem.
- The entire game is now saved when an old board position is viewed (#150)
- The app should no longer crash after receiving a memory warning on iOS 5
  while the "Game info", "New game" or "Save game" screens are displayed
  (#157). Thanks to the anonymous iPad 1 user who patiently reminded me that
  the issue needs fixing by sending an occasional crash report.
- Fix for a memory leak in TableViewSliderCell (#155)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.11.0 (April 20 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- Display coordinate labels (#12). This can be turned on or off under
  "Settings > Play view > Display coordinates".
- Display move numbers (#17). The user preference can be found under
  "Settings > Play view > Display move numbers". Because displaying many move
  numbers is cluttering the board, the percentage of move numbers to display
  can be adjusted with a slider.
- Zoom the board up to a 3x zoom scale (#16). All standard zoom gestures are
  supported. Because zooming costs memory the user may want to limit herself
  to a maximum zoom scale that is below 3x. This can be done with the slider
  found under "Settings > Play view > Maximum zoom". A limit of 2x zoom scale
  is recommended for devices that do not have much RAM (typically older
  devices such as the iPhone 3GS or the iPad 1st generation).
- Archived games can now be exported to Mail (#19) and other apps that are
  capable of processing .sgf files (e.g. DropBox).
- Games can now be imported from Mail (#20) and other apps that are capable
  of exporting .sgf files (e.g. DropBox).

==============================
Other improvements and changes
==============================
- The application now launches much faster (#114), except for the first time
  after upgrading from a previous version.
- Status text and activity indicator are now displayed in the navigation bar
  at the top of the screen (#120).
- When a new game is started, the "discard old game" question is not displayed
  anymore if there have been no changes since the game was saved the last
  time (#42).
- Loading a game from the archive is now about 10% faster (commit 139bb46).
- Drawing of Go board now makes better use of the available space. This is
  especially noticeable for the large 19x19 board on a small iPhone screen
  (commit 86443d9).
- The "stone distance from fingertip" user preference now behaves more
  predictably: Previously a "clever" algorithm tried to figure out the "best"
  distance by taking into account various parameters such as board size and
  screen size. The new algorithm now simply scales a fixed maximum distance
  according to the value of the slider.

========
Bugfixes
========
- No longer crash when a computer vs. computer game is restored during app
  launch and that game has already ended (#127). Thanks to Serge Grossenbacher
  for reporting this bug.
- No longer draw in secondary thread during app launch (#117). This eliminates
  another potential source of crashes.
- iPad only: Screen should no longer be flickering wildly after loading some
  games from the archive (#126).
- It is now possible to save games with a name that consists of 1 or 2
  characters (#125).
- Resigning is no longer possible when viewing an old board position. This
  fixes the problem that resigning when viewing an old board position corrupts
  the backup .sgf (#115).
- During scoring, the activity indicator is now only displayed for finding
  the initial set of dead stones (#121).

==========
Known bugs
==========
- App may crash when board position is changed (possibly forward going only)
  (#128)
- App crashes when user plays an illegal move while viewing an old board
  position (#129)
- App crashes during launch after a player has been deleted (#130)

=================
Technical changes
=================
- MBProgressHUD upgraded to the newest version (HEAD of the git repository).
  The progress indicator is now a round shape instead of a horizontal bar.
- Private Objective-C method declarations in .m files have been removed to
  reduce unnecessary code duplication (#102).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.10.0 (March 01 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
Improve graphic design
======================
- Add wooden background
- Add artwork for black/white/cross-hair stones (instead of just drawing
  filled circles)
- New layout on iPad
- New icon for "continue" button in computer vs. computer games, to
  distinguish it from the new "forward" button

========
Features
========
- View board positions for moves played earlier during the game
- Replace "undo" with "discard move"
- A game that has ended can now be resumed in two ways:
  - Discard the most recent move if two pass moves were played by mistake
  - Select "Undo resign" from the game actions menu after accidentally
    resigning the game
- Redesign of "New game" and "Game info" screens
- New user preferences
  - Settings > Play view > Stone distance from fingertip
  - Setting > Board position > Discard future moves alert
  - Settings > Scoring > Score when game ends
- Add support for collecting logging data
  - Turn this on under Diagnostics > Collect logging data
  - Logging data is automatically included in a bug report
- Do not trigger the computer player when a computer vs. computer game is
  restored on app launch
- Add placeholder message to "Archive" tab if there are no saved games
- Various other small GUI updates and fixes

========
Bugfixes
========
- App no longer crashes if a computer vs. computer game is paused and the
  computer passes or resigns
- Diagnostics > Bug report section is no longer disabled when computer player
  resigns
- Fix various memory leaks
- GUI updates during long-running actions (e.g. app launch, load game) should
  now happen always in the main thread; besides smoother GUI updates, this
  should eliminate one more possible source of crashes

==========
Known bugs
==========
- The resigned state of a game is lost when a game is saved or loaded; this
  is not new in this release, it's just been added to the list of known bugs

=================
Technical changes
=================
- Upgrade project to Xcode 4.6
- Drop support for iOS 4.3, the minimum required version is now iOS 5.0
- Add iOS 6 compatibility
- Add iPhone 5 support
- Improve 3rd party software build process
- Upgrade CocoaLumberjack to version 1.6
- Update Doxygen target to use the MacPorts path /opt/local/bin


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.2 (December 22 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Bugfixes
========
- Fix for crash if Play tab is not visible and low memory conditions occur
  (issue #86)
- Fix for crash if an error occurs while loading an archived game, e.g.
  because the game contains an illegal move (issue #88)
- Fix for crash when Little Go thinks that a move made by the computer player
  is illegal. Note that the root cause of the problem has not yet been
  identified, but at least the app no longer crashes when the condition
  occurs. Instead you will be asked to submit a bug report (please do!), the
  game in progress is automatically saved to the archive and a new game is
  started to bring the app back into a stable state. This temporary solution
  will remain in place until I can track down and fix the actual bug
  (issue #90).
- Fix for memory leak that occurs when the Game Info view has been selected
  on the Play tab, but the Play tab is not visible and low memory conditions
  occur (issue #87)
- Fix for memory leak when a bug report is sent (issue #91)
- Fix for GUI update errors on Play tab after an error occurs while loading a
  game (issue #89)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.1 (December 09 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Bugfixes
========
- Another bug in the Ko detection logic is now fixed. For instance the
  following sequence: Black A2, White B2, Black pass, White C1, Black pass,
  White A1. If Black now tries to capture on B1, this was erroneously thought
  to be illegal due to Ko.

=================
Technical changes
=================
- The project's bugtracker is now hosted on GitHub
  (https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/issues)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.0 (November 23 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- 3 new settings have been added to profiles (maximum number of playout games,
  maximum thinking time, ponder time). These settings provide much improved
  control over the computer player's playing strength.
- Individual profile settings are now hidden in an "Advanced configuration"
  screen. The user can still tweak those settings if she wants to, but there
  is also a simplified "playing strength" screen where, by selecting a playing
  strength, the user adjusts several profile settings in a single action,
  without having to know the technical details behind each setting.
- The computer player can now be interrupted when it is thinking.
- The user can now choose to send a crash report if the app crashes (available
  when the app is launched the next time after the crash). Settings are
  available on the "Diagnostics" tab. Read the in-game manual for more
  information.
- The user can now send send a bug report email with attached diagnostics
  information file from within the app. The function is available on the
  "Diagnostics" tab. Read the in-game manual for more information.
- The Game Info view now displays the currently active profile.

========
Bugfixes
========
- Loading an .sgf file with bad content no longer crashes the app. Thanks to
  Andrew Hersee for reporting this bug.
- iPhone only: The Status line is now 2 lines high and no longer truncates
  texts. Thanks to Andrew Hersee for reporting this bug.
- Improved protection against data loss after a crash (preferences data is
  saved more often, and the game in progress is saved after every move).
  Thanks to Tripp Lilley for reporting this bug.
- It is no longer possible to enter empty profile and player names
- iPad only: The Go board is now properly resized when the interface
  orientation changes while the "Play" tab is not visible
- Display an error message when an illegal save game name is entered (instead
  of just silently not saving the game)

=================
Technical changes
=================
- The project's source code is now hosted on GitHub
  (https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/)
- The project now has a Trello board where you can see what is currently being
  worked on (https://trello.com/board/little-go/4fd84c295027333d460dcc32)
- An Ohloh page now provides mildly interesting source code statistics
  (https://www.ohloh.net/p/littlego)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.1 (June 12 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- New application icon
- Added "Quick Start Guide" section to in-game help

========
Bugfixes
========
- A bug in a low-level function, which has been present in all versions of
  Little Go since its initial App Store release, has finally been found and
  exterminated. The bug caused "Undo" to not work correctly in certain
  situations. The error, when it manifested, did not have an immediate visible
  impact in the GUI, instead it caused all sorts of follow-up problems to
  occur (capturing stones might not work, suicide moves might be allowed,
  marking dead stones in scoring mode might not work correctly, and in some
  extreme cases it might even cause the app to crash).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.0 (April 17 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- iPad version with support for retina display and all interface orientations
- iPhone now supports upside-down portrait orientation
- improved in-game help

========
Bugfixes
========
- loading a game is now much faster
- drawing, especially while moving a stone around the board, now uses 10-15%
  less CPU power, which improves battery life
- Ko is no longer erroneously detected in certain situations (e.g. black has
  stones on A2, B1, B3, C1, C3, white has stones on B2 and C2; black now plays
  on D2, white on B2; in this situation, black C2 was erroneously thought to
  be illegal due to Ko)
- profiles: "reuse subtree" is now always enabled (and cannot be disabled)
  when pondering is enabled; previously the two settings were independent of
  each other, which was a bug
- loading archived game now works even if temporary file is still around for
  some reason

=================
Technical changes
=================
- rewrite of Play view drawing code
- lots of new unit tests
- upgrade to iOS SDK 5.1


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.1 (January 03 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Bugfixes
========
- loading a game with no moves is now handled correctly (previously the app
  would hang and needed to be manually killed to get into a usable state
  again)
- capturing moves that "almost" create a Ko are now correctly recognized as
  legal moves (e.g. black A1, white A2, black D1, white B2, black C2,
  white C1, previously the black move on B1 was thought to be illegal)
- it is no longer possible to place stones outside the board in the top-left
  and top-right corners
- board size 7x7 no longer allows handicaps greater than 4 (selecting such
  a handicap previously would result in no handicap being set at all)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7 (December 20 2011)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first release published to the App Store

========
Features
========
  - added application, tab bar and toolbar icons

  - rename "Debug" tab to "Diagnostics"

================
User preferences
================
- none

========
Bugfixes
========
- dead stones are now always marked correctly (they were not marked correctly
  in release builds due to an uninitialized variable)
- enabling scoring mode in mid-game made further game play impossible; this
  has been fixed

=================
Technical changes
=================
- eliminated various memory leaks
- application startup now mostly happens in a secondary thread; this makes
  it possible to run the application through Instruments


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6 (December 04 2011)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- a stone is now displayed immediately when fingertip touches the board
- GTP engine settings are now managed in profiles (instead of as player
  attributes)
- an alert is displayed, and game and user preferences are now saved as an
  emergency when iOS sends a memory warning
- the game info view now displays entries for "last move" and "next move"
- cross-hair point distance from fingertip is now scaled based on board size
- default board size is now 9x9 (down from 19x19)
- new "Help" and "Credits" documents
- all license documents are now displayed in their own table view

================
User preferences
================
- all user-defined players are removed on upgrade
- all scoring user defaults are lost on upgrade
- new user preferences for "inconsistent territory" (scoring) and
  "place stone under finger" (play view)
- reorganization of Settings view into topical sections

========
Bugfixes
========

========
Features
========
- when a new game is started it is now possible to select a handicap (up to
  9 stones in fixed locations) and a komi value
- the user can now "flip" the Play view to see an Info view which displays
  information about the current game
- new accurate scoring mode
  - when activated, the user can now interactively mark stone groups on the
    Play view as dead or alive
  - territory scoring is based on stone groups' dead or alive status
  - the Info view displays detailed tabular scoring information
  - scoring mode is activated automatically when the game ends, or by the
    user at any time during normal game play
- the status line on the Play view now displays a message if the computer
  player passed

========
Bugfixes
========
- the GTP log now displays all commands (previously some commands were lost)

=================
Technical changes
=================
- none


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4 (October 31 2011)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- the GTP log on the Debug view is now a table view (the raw log is still
  available by switching to the view's "backside")
- arbitrary commands can now be submitted to the GTP engine
- GTP commands can be "canned" for later or repeated submission
- interruptions (e.g. a phone call) now pause a computer vs. computer game

=================
- add Cocoa Lumberjack logging framework


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 (September 25 2011)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
========
Features
========
- computer players now have a set of GTP engine attributes that allow to
  limit memory consumption and, to a certain degree, playing strength
- game archive
  - a game in progress can now be saved
  - existing games can be managed on a separate "Archive" tab
  - the game archive is accessible from iTunes so that archived games can be
    transferred to/from the iOS device when it is connected to iTunes
- the game in progress is auto-saved when the application is put into the
  background so that the game is not lost if the application is subsequently
  killed for any reason
- Play view now uses a grey instead of a b/w color scheme

========
Bugfixes
========
- by default the GTP engine now uses 64 MB memory only; on an iPhone 3GS with
  256 MB memory this limit is sufficient that the system no longer kills the
  application because it uses up too much memory
- application no longer hangs if GTP engine responds with error to final_score
- capturing moves with a single stone now work correctly
- pass moves are no longer drawn on the Go board
- toolbar buttons on Play view now use an explicit text label instead of
  confusing icons

=================
Technical changes
=================
- less view updates on the Play view, which means less power consumption and
  slightly snappier panning
- add command processor design pattern
- GTP commands can now be executed synchronously


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
