Quick Start Guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you launch the app for the first time, you will find yourself on the "Play"
tab where the game board is displayed. A new game on a 9x9 board has already
been set up for you: You play black, the computer plays white. The game has
komi 7½ and no handicap. The rules in effect are simple ko and area scoring.

To place a stone, simply touch the screen somewhere in the middle of the board,
then <strong>keep your fingertip on the screen</strong> until the stone appears.
Move your fingertip to move the stone. When you lift your fingertip, the stone
will be placed.

If you are on an iPhone, the stone is placed a short distance above your
fingertip. <strong>This is intentional!</strong> The reason is that on the small
screen of the iPhone your fingertip partially obscures one or more intersections
(especially on larger boards such as 19x19), making it difficult to accurately
place a stone. Displaying the stone slightly above your fingertip tries to work
around this problem. If you don't like this behaviour, you can turn it off: On
the "Settings" tab, select the "Touch interaction" entry and move the slider
"Stone distance from fingertip" to the lowest setting.

To conclude this "Quick start" guide, the following list gives you an idea of
what each one of the buttons in the toolbar at the top of the screen does. The
buttons are explained from left to right.

- "Computer play" button: Tap this if you don't know where to play, or are just
  lazy ☺. The computer will then make a move on your behalf.
- "Pass" button: Tap this if you want to pass instead of placing a stone.
- "Discard" button: This button is visible only if you have made at least one
  move. Tapping this button discards the last move made by you or the computer
  player. If you discard the computer player's move, it will <em>not</em>
  automatically replay its move. This way you have the opportunity to tap the
  button again and thus discard your own move. If, however, you want to let the
  computer replay its move you can do so by tapping the "Computer play" button.
- "Interrupt" button: This button is visible only while the computer is
  thinking. You can tap the button to interrupt and force the computer to play
  its best move <em>right now</em>. If the computer was playing on your behalf,
  it will immediately start thinking about its own move, so you may have to
  interrupt again (e.g. if you want to access the menu behind the "Game actions"
  button).
- "Game info" button: Tap this to call up the "Game info" screen where you can
  see all sorts of interesting things about the game in progress (e.g. the
  score).
- "Game actions" button: Tapping this displays a menu with these additional
  functions: Switch to scoring mode, resign the game (or undo the decision to
  resign), save the game, and start a new game. You may find additional or fewer
  entries in this menu, depending on the current state of the game or your
  current settings.

This was just a quick overview of the basic features of this app. It's best to
explore the app a bit for yourself, then come back and read the rest of the
manual in case you have more questions. If you don't know yet the rules of the
game of Go, please consult the "Go rules" section.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================
Why is the stone not placed where my finger touches the board?
==============================================================
If you are on an iPhone, the stone is placed a short distance above your
fingertip. <strong>This is intentional!</strong> The reason is that on the small
screen of the iPhone your fingertip partially obscures one or more intersections
(especially on larger boards such as 19x19), making it difficult to accurately
place a stone. Displaying the stone slightly above your fingertip tries to work
around this problem.

If you don't like this behaviour, you can turn it off: On the "Settings" tab,
select the "Touch interaction" entry and move the slider "Stone distance from
fingertip" to the lowest setting.

===============================
How do I change the board size?
===============================
You need to start a new game. See the next question.

==========================
How do I start a new game?
==========================
Go to the "Play" tab (the one that displays the board). Tap the "Game actions"
button on the right-hand side of the toolbar at the top of the screen. Select
"New game" from the menu that appears.

====================================================
What are the functions of all those toolbar buttons?
====================================================
Read the "Quick Start Guide" section for an overview, or the "How to play"
section for the full story.

=====================================================
The computer is too strong / too weak, what can I do?
=====================================================
1. On the "Play" tab, tap the "Game info" button to find out which profile is
   active (select the "Game" segment then scroll down to the section titled
   "Game Information" to find this information).
1. Tap the "Active profile" entry. This will take you directly to a screen
   where you can edit the profile's settings.
1. Tap on "Playing strength", select a new value, then tap "Done".
1. Tap "Done" to dismiss the "Edit profile" screen. The new playing strength
   will immediately take effect.

In step 3, you can instead tap "Advanced configuration" if you want to tweak
individual profile settings. Consult the "Players & Profiles" section of the
manual to learn about the meaning of each setting, especially "Max. memory"
which is a somewhat dangerous setting. You may also be interested in reading the
chapter "Limiting the computer's playing strength", which appears in the manual
after the description of the individual profile settings.

=========================================================================
Player influence is not displayed, or is completely wrong, what can I do?
=========================================================================
Tap the "Game actions" button and select "Update player influence" from the
menu.

If you don't see this menu entry, you need to enable "Display player influence"
under "Settings > Display settings". If this setting is already enabled, then
you are in scoring mode which prevents the display of player influence. Tap the
"Done" button to disable scoring mode. If you still don't see player influence,
select the "Update player influence" menu entry mentioned above.

Also read the "Player influence" section of this manual to learn about important
background information.

=====================================================================================================
Move numbers/coordinate labels are not displayed even though they are enabled in the user preferences
=====================================================================================================
Little Go automatically calculates the font size that is required to display
move numbers and coordinate labels. The font size depends on the board size (a
bigger board means a smaller font) and the amount of space available for drawing
the board (a smaller screen means a smaller font). If as a result of these
calculations the font becomes too small, you will no longer be able to read
move numbers and coordinate labels. Little Go in this case decides that it is
better to not display those items at all, and to use the space thus gained for
drawing a board that is slightly larger.

To still see move numbers and coordinate labels you just have to zoom the board
sufficiently. Once the zoom scale has reached a certain degree, things will
automatically start to show up.

=================================
What is an "Auto-created player"?
=================================
When Little Go launches, it automatically starts a game with those two players
that it remembers were playing last time when the app was active. If for any
reason one or both of those players no longer exist, Little Go will try to
recover by automatically creating one or two new players. Players created in
this way get the name "Auto-created player" to give you a hint what happened.

In practice, you should never see an auto-created player. However, if you
<em>do</em> see one, and you know how you managed to convince Little Go to
create it, please let me know so that I can fix the problem.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

====================================
Computer player making illegal moves
====================================
It is possible that Little Go and the computer player (i.e. Fuego) disagree on
when a move is legal. Usually this happens when Little Go and Fuego get out of
sync, most often due to some bug in Little Go. If such a situation occurs,
Little Go will ask you to submit a bug report, or to enable the collecting of
logging data (so that when the problem occurs the next time, the bug report can
be sent with useful information about the steps that led up to the problem).

Regardless of whether you agree to Little Go's suggestions, the game in progress
will then be automatically saved to the archive and a new game will be started
to bring the app back into a stable state. To continue playing you can try to
load the saved game from the archive.

========================================================
I can/cannot play X - isn't this against the game rules?
========================================================
You may have found a bug. Don't hesitate to email me with a bug report - the
manual section "Reporting bugs" has all the details how to go about this.

Meanwhile, if you are stuck in an impossible situation (e.g. you cannot capture
a stone), you can try to work around the problem by saving the game that is
currently in progress, then reloading the game you just saved. Loading a saved
game is a generally useful strategy to bring Little Go back into a sane state
whenever the app behaves buggy.

=============================
Crash after zooming the board
=============================
If the app crashes after you zoom the board it is likely that your device does
not have enough memory to support both a fully zoomed board AND the computer
player's memory requirements. If this happens, you probably have increased the
computer player's "Max. memory" setting and should try to reduce that number
again to a safe level.

===================================================
I cannot load a game, the "Load" button is disabled
===================================================
When you view the details of a saved game on the "Archive" tab, the "Load"
button is disabled as long as the computer is busy thinking (either for itself,
or on behalf of a human player who has tapped the "Computer play" button).
If a computer vs. computer game is currently in progress, you have to pause the
game for the button to become enabled.

============================================================
I cannot load a game, the game is reported to contain errors
============================================================
Little Go will never be able to gracefully handle .sgf files with content that
violates the game rules (e.g. two black moves in a row). My vision for Little Go
is a program that lets you play the game of Go. Nothing more. Saving a game in
Little Go will result in an .sgf with legal moves, so this is what the app
should be able to load again. Nothing more.

If you still believe that Little Go should be able to load one of your .sgf game
files, then please write a bug report and attach the .sgf file in question.

===================================================
File sharing via iTunes does not update the archive
===================================================
Since iOS 5, if you add or remove files via iTunes file sharing, the screen on
the "Archive" tab does not update automatically. This is a known problem, and as
far as I know there is no fix for this. However, a simple workaround is to
temporarily lock the device. After the device is unlocked again, the screen on
the "Archive" tab will update itself.

===============================================================
Resigned state of a game is lost when a game is saved or loaded
===============================================================
When a player resigns and the game is saved, the information about the player
resigning is lost, i.e. is not part of the resulting .sgf file. Conversely, if
an .sgf file is loaded that contains a game where one of the players resigned,
that information is not picked up by Little Go.

This is a known problem. For details see GitHub issue #97
(https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/issues/97).

==========================================================
The computer player plays stupid moves during the end game
==========================================================
The computer player is not very good at calculating the final score on its own.
One consequence of this is that you must assist in determining dead stones
during scoring. Another consequence is that the computer player is not usually
passing early during the end game - it stubbornly keeps on playing far longer
than a human player would. If you are playing with area scoring rules, this
usually does not affect the final score and thus is merely annoying. If you are
playing with territory scoring rules, however, the computer player may lose a
game that it would have won with area scoring rules. In some cases the computer
player may even resign because its automated territory scoring calculations are
incorrect.

For these reasons, you should try to play with area scoring rules. That's also
why Little Go uses area scoring rules by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Go lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone or iPad. If you don't know
the rules of Go you can find an extremely short, text-only introduction in one
of the last section in this help (titled "Go rules"). For a more thorough
approach I recommend visiting one of the many websites dedicated to the game;
my personal favourite is "Sensei's Library" (http://senseis.xmp.net/).

You can play the game against another human (in "hot-seat" mode on the same
device), or against the computer. The "How to play" section in this help will
provide you with a good overview of what you can do when you see the game board.
For an ultra-short introduction you may also wish to have a look at the "Quick
Start Guide" section.

The computer player built into Little Go is powered by the open source software
library Fuego (http://fuego.sourceforge.net/), which is a pretty nasty
opponent ☺ on smaller boards, and can also be challenging on larger boards if
you tune up its number-crunching power. The "Players & Profiles" help section
tells you more about how to make Fuego stronger or weaker.

When a game is over you will usually want to know who has won. Little Go is not
very smart about calculating the score - it relies quite heavily on your help
with evaluating which stones on the board are alive, which ones are dead and
which ones are in seki. The "Scoring" section has details about how all this
stuff is supposed to work.

When you save a game it will appear in the archive from where you can load it
again at a later time, delete it, or transfer it via iTunes to your computer.
Read "The archive" section for more information.

Finally, if you are interested in the way how Little Go and Fuego talk to each
other, you should study the technical information in the "GTP engine" section.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to play
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================
How to read this
================
This section is written as a "narrative" which should be read from top to bottom
by first-time users.

===================
Starting a new game
===================
When you launch the app it displays the "Play" tab with the game board. It also
automatically starts a new game, using the settings that you gave it the last
time you yourself started a new game. If this is the very first time that you
run Little Go, it will start with a few default settings: A 9x9 board, no
handicap, a komi of 7½, simple ko rules, area scoring, and a human vs. a
computer player.

To start a new game yourself, tap the "Game actions" button on the right-hand
side of the toolbar at the top of the screen, then select "New game" from the
menu that appears.

Komi is adjusted automatically in the following situations:
- Selecting a scoring system sets a default komi suitable for the scoring system
  (7½ for area scoring, 6½ for territory scoring).
- Selecting a handicap sets komi to ½. Selecting no handicap sets komi back to
  the current scoring system's default. While a handicap is selected, changing
  the scoring system has no effect on komi.

===============
Placing a stone
===============
Start placing a stone by touching the screen near the intersection where you
want the stone to end up. The stone appears after a small delay, either a short
distance away from your fingertip (on the iPhone) or directly under your
fingertip (on the iPad), but is not yet placed. Move your finger around the
screen until you are satisfied with the stone's location, then place the stone
by taking away your finger from the screen. Voilà.

If you feel irritated because the stone does not appear directly under your
fingertip (default behaviour on the iPhone only), you can turn this feature off
in the preferences by moving the slider under
"Settings > Touch interaction > Stone distance from fingertip" to its lowest
setting. You probably won't see the stone anymore because your fingertip covers
it, but if you watch the status text in the toolbar above the game board you
will see the coordinates of the intersection where the stone would be placed
should you lift your finger now.

===================
The computer player
===================
If your opponent is a computer player, it will take over immediately after you
have made your move. While the computer player is thinking, an "Interrupt"
button is displayed in the toolbar. Usually you will want to wait until the
computer has finished thinking and made its move, but if you want you can tap
the button to interrupt and force the computer to play its best move
<em>right now</em>.

If you want to do something else while the computer is thinking, you can always
switch to one of the other tabs (e.g. to read more of this help). If you would
like to get a notification when the computer has made its move you can turn on
audio/vibration feedback options under "Settings > Sound & Vibration".

You may have noticed that Little Go has two pre-configured computer players,
"Fuego" and "Fuego (weak)". If you want to know more about the different playing
strengths of computer players you should start reading the "Players & Profiles"
help section.

==========================
Computer vs. Computer game
==========================
When you start a new game you can select a computer player to play against
itself. Because only one profile (see "Players & Profiles" help section) can be
active at a time, it is not possible to select different players for black and
white.

In a computer vs. computer game you can't do much more than enjoy watching them
battling it out ☺. The "Interrupt" toolbar button lets you cut short the current
computer player's thinking, forcing it to play the best move it has calculated
so far. If you want to interrupt the whole game you have to tap the "Pause"
toolbar button. Once the computer player whose turn it currently is has finished
its move, the "Game actions" toolbar button becomes enabled so that you can, for
instance, save the game in progress or start a new game. Tap the "Continue"
toolbar button to let the players continue their match.

A computer vs. computer game is automatically paused when the device's screen is
locked, when you receive a phone call, or whenever some other interruption
occurs. Also note that audio/vibration feedback preferences are ignored in a
computer vs. computer game because you are merely a spectator and not actively
participating in the game.

=============================
Let the computer play for you
=============================
If you don't know where to play, or are just lazy ☺, you can let the computer
play for you by tapping the "Computer play" toolbar button. Even though the
computer is now playing on your behalf, you can interrupt it by tapping the
"Interrupt" toolbar button. If your opponent is a computer player, that player
will immediately take over, just as if you had made your own move.

==============================
Making a move for the computer
==============================
You can never play on behalf of the computer! Whenever there is a situation
where it is the computer player's turn and it does not automatically make its
move, you will find that the "Computer play" button is enabled. Tapping the
button will tell the computer to make its move.

================
Discarding moves
================
If you are not happy with a move you or your opponent made, you can tap the
"Discard" toolbar button (visible only if at least one move was made). This will
throw away the move that was just made. Whoever made that move can now play
again, either somewhere else on the board or at the same intersection. You can
also continue to discard more moves.

When you discard a computer player's move and it is now the computer's turn to
play, it does not automatically make its move. You can tell it do so by tapping
the "Computer play" button (as mentioned a little bit further up in the "Making
a move for the computer" section).

==============================
Resuming a game that has ended
==============================
If the game has ended by two consecutive pass moves you can simply discard the
last move (i.e. the second pass move) to resume the game and continue playing.
Of course, you cannot force your opponent to not play a pass move again.

If the game has ended because a player resigned, you can undo the decision to
resign from the menu that pops up when you tap the "Game actions" button. The
decision to resign is also undone automatically when you discard the last move.

================
Game information
================
Tapping the "Game info" toolbar button calls up a screen that shows all sorts of
interesting things about the game that is currently in progress. For instance
you can see which player's turn it is (on the "Game" segment), but probably the
most interesting part is the "Score" segment which has a table that tells you
who would win if the game would end right now. Note that you need to activate
scoring mode if you want the table to display area or territory scores. See the
"Scoring" help section for more information.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Board positions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

======================
The navigation toolbar
======================
Besides the main toolbar which contains the buttons for playing the game, there
is a second toolbar with a set of navigation buttons that allow you to jump back
and forth in the game's move history.

On the iPhone the navigation toolbar is at the bottom of the screen, just below
the game board. On the iPad the navigation toolbar is at the top of the
left-hand side of the screen when you hold the device in landscape orientation.
When you hold the iPad in portrait orientation, the navigation toolbar is not
visible by default, but you can touch the screen and swipe from left to right
to slide in a pane that has the navigation toolbar at the top. In portrait
orientation the main toolbar also has a button labelled "Moves": Tapping this
button has the same effect as a left-to-right swiping gesture.

======================
The navigation buttons
======================
These are the buttons in the navigation toolbar, and their function:

- The "<" and "> buttons go back and forward one move.
- The "|<" button goes back to the beginning of the game, before the first move
  was made.
- The ">|" button goes forward to the last move of the game.

Whenever you tap one of these buttons, the board displays the <em>board
position</em> after the respective move was made.

============================================
"Current board position" information display
============================================
On the iPhone there is a small area on the right-hand side of the navigation
toolbar which displays information about the board position you are currently
viewing. On the iPad this area is located just below the navigation toolbar on
the left-hand side of the screen.

The information display usually shows the following details:

- The number of the move that created the board position you are currently
  viewing
- The color of the player who made the move
- The intersection where the stone was placed, or "Pass" if the move was a pass
  move
- The number of stones captured by the move (if any). On the iPhone this number
  is displayed in red.

As a special case, when you are viewing the board position at the beginning of
the game (i.e. before the first move was made) the information display shows the
values for handicap and komi.

=======================
List of board positions
=======================
On the iPhone you can tap the small area that shows the "current board position"
information display. This will hide the navigation buttons and instead show a
scrollable list of board positions. Tap the small "current board position" area
again to switch back to the navigation buttons. On the iPad the list of board
positions is always visible just below the "current board position" area.

When you tap a list entry, the board displays the corresponding board position,
just as if you had navigated to it using one of the navigation buttons.

==================
"Next move" marker
==================
When you view an old board position, the character "A" is used to mark the
intersection where the next move will place a stone. The "A" marker is not
displayed if the next move is a pass move. You can permanently disable the "A"
marker in the user preferences under "Settings > Board position".

===========================================
Playing while viewing an old board position
===========================================
When you view an old board position and it is your turn to play, you can make
a move just as you would during regular game play. Making that move, however,
will discard all future moves after the board position you are viewing. You
will see an alert when this happens, giving you the opportunity to abort and
keep those future moves. You can disable the alert in the user preferences under
"Settings > Board position".

When you view an old board position and it is the computer's turn to play, you
can tap the "Computer play" button to let the computer make a move. Unless you
have disabled it, the same alert about future moves being discarded will be
displayed.

===============
Game variations
===============
You might be used to game variations from other, more sophisticated
applications. Little Go currently has no support for game variations, which is
why you must discard future moves when you want to play while you view an old
board position.

==============================================
Discarding while viewing an old board position
==============================================
When you view an old board position and you tap the "Discard" button, the move
that created the board position you are viewing will be discarded, along with
all future moves. As with playing (see above), you will be alerted when this is
happening, and you can disable the alert in the user preferences.

===========================================
Scoring while viewing an old board position
===========================================
When you look at the score in the "Game info" screen, it will be based on the
board position you are currently viewing. When you are in scoring mode and
you navigate to a different board position, the scoring information is updated
automatically to reflect the new board position. At the same time, any decisions
that you made on which stones are dead or in seki are forgotten.

See the "Scoring" help section if you need more information about scoring.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player influence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========
Overview
========
Under "Settings > Display" you will find a switch labelled
"Display player influence". If you turn this setting on, most intersections on
the board will start to show black and white squares of varying size. The color
of the square indicates which player has more influence on that intersection,
while the size of the square indicates the degree of influence that player has
(the larger the square the more influence a player has). By looking at the
influence squares on the entire board you can quickly estimate which parts of
the board will end up being owned by which player.

<strong>Important:</strong> Player influence is subjective - it is determined
by what the computer player "sees" or "thinks". Therefore, if you play against a
weak computer player, the player influence being displayed may well be
inaccurate, simply because the computer player in its weakness has missed a
particularly good move. Even with a strong computer player, you should always
take player influence with a grain of salt. Read the "Technical background"
section further down to learn more.

===============================
Calculation of player influence
===============================
Player influence will not be visible immediately after you turn it on. The
reason for this is that the computer has not yet collected any of the statistics
data that is required to display player influence. Player influence will become
visible only after the computer player makes its next move (either its own move,
or when it plays on your behalf).

Once the initial player influence is visible, it will be updated every time that
the computer player makes a move. On the other hand, player influence will
<em>never</em> be updated if the computer player does not make a move. The
consequence is that you will see outdated/inaccurate player influence in the
following situations:
- When you play against the computer, player influence is not updated
  immediately after you make your own move. Player influence is updated only
  after the computer has finished calculating its answering move.
- When you play against a human opponent, player influence is never updated
  unless one of you lets the computer make a move on your behalf.
- When you view old board positions, player influence is never updated because
  the computer never makes calculations while you jump back and forth in the
  game's move history.

You can <em>force</em> player influence to be re-calculated by tapping the
"Game actions" toolbar button and selecting the "Update player influence" menu
entry. The calculation will take a while to complete, during that time you will
not be able to play. The menu entry is not shown when player influence cannot be
re-calculated (e.g. during scoring mode) or, obviously, if the
"Display player influence" setting is disabled.

====================
Technical background
====================
The computer's method to calculate its best move is to play out a huge amount of
hypothetical games in the background, and to evaluate the outcome of each of
these playouts. A by-product, so to speak, of each playout is the information
whether at the end of the hypothetical game an intersection remains neutral, or
belongs to the area owned by black or white.

By summing up the results of all playouts, it is therefore possible to say for
any given intersection whether it was owned by black more often than by white,
or vice versa, or whether there was a tie. The color of the player who owned
an intersection more often determines the color of the influence square. The
<em>size</em> of the influence square is determined by comparing the percentage
of playouts won by either black or white.

The accuracy of these playout statistics is governed by how many playout games
the computer is allowed to calculate. Few playout games means low accuracy
because a particularly strong move and all the playout games descending from it
may easily be overlooked. At the same, few playout games also means a weak
computer player. In effect, there is a direct relationship between computer
player strength and the accuracy of playout statistics / player influence.

Read the "Players & profiles" section of this manual for more details about how
to adjust the computer player's playing strength.

=====================================
Influence on computer player strength
=====================================
The computer player becomes slightly weaker while the display of player
influence is enabled. The reason is that collecting the player influence
statistics data requires a bit of calculation power that would otherwise be
available for calculating the computer's best move.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players & Profiles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========
Overview
========
You can manage both players and profiles under "Settings > Players & Profiles".

There are two types of players: Human players and computer players. A human
player only has a name, while a computer player is additionally associated with
a profile.

A profile is a collection of settings, each of which defines a certain technical
aspect of how the computer calculates its moves. The combination of settings in
a profile directly influences the computer's playing strength. By associating a
weak or a strong profile with a computer player, you define whether it will be
a weak or a strong opponent.

To become active, a profile must be associated with a computer player, and that
player must participate in a game. If you make changes to the active profile,
those changes will immediately take effect when you dismiss the "Edit profile"
screen.

Only one profile can be active at any given time.

=====================
The "Default" profile
=====================
When you install Little Go for the first time, the top-most profile in the
list of preconfigured profiles is named "Default". Although you are allowed to
modify its settings, you can never delete the profile. Even if you rename the
profile, it retains its special status as the default profile.

The reason is a technical one: When a new game with two human players is
started, and one of them requests Little Go to calculate a move for him or her
by tapping the "Computer play" button, Little Go requires a profile with
settings that the computer can use for calculating the move. Little Go in this
situation chooses the specially tagged default profile.

You can also think of this from a different angle: Changing the settings of the
default profile will have an influence on the quality of the moves generated by
tapping the "Computer play" button in human vs. human games.

=====================================================
Simple vs. advanced configuration of playing strength
=====================================================
The simplest way to change the settings of a profile is to select from a number
of playing strengths when you are on the "Edit profile" screen. Playing strength
1 is the weakest, playing strength 2 is slightly better, and so on. Each playing
strength represents a different set of predefined settings values. By selecting
a playing strength you are effectively changing many profile settings in a
single go, without having to understand what the individual settings do.

Individual profile settings are also open to manual tweaking. To do so, go to
the "Advanced configuration" screen from the "Edit profile" screen. Before you
start changing things, however, it is probably a good idea to first read through
the next sections so that you better understand what you can accomplish by
manipulating the different settings.

================
Resign behaviour
================
A profile also has a resign behaviour which defines how quickly a computer
player using the profile will resign the game. The simple configuration lets you
choose from five predefined resign behaviours, while the advanced configuration
allows you to define a threshold percentage for each board size.

Here are a couple of ideas on what you can do with specific resign behaviours:
- If the computer player is allowed to resign normally, it will often resign
  immediately when it is faced with an overwhelming handicap (e.g. handicap 6
  on a 9x9 board). Setting the resign behaviour to "Never resign", however,
  allows beginners to play with a large handicap on small boards.
- Strong players who can beat the computer but who like to play out the game to
  the very end can set the resign behaviour to "Stubborn" or even to
  "Never resign" to get the most out of a game.

==============
Maximum memory
==============
This setting defines how much memory in MB the computer is allowed to use for
its calculations. In general, the more memory it gets, the better the computer
will play. There are a few things that you need to be aware of, though:

- Most important is that your iPhone or iPad only has a limited amount of
  memory, and Little Go must share this memory with all the other applications
  that also run on the device. If iOS (the operating system running on your
  device) finds that Little Go behaves badly and uses up too much memory, it
  will terminate Little Go after a short delay so that the other applications
  can continue running. To minimize the chance that this happens, Little Go
  limits the amount of memory you can assign here to a fraction of the amount
  of physical memory that the device has.
- More threads (see below) usually need more memory to be effective
- Faster processors will be happy if they get more memory because they can
  calculate more than slower processors in the same amount of time

=================
Number of threads
=================
This setting defines how many calculations the computer is allowed to make in
parallel. In general, the more threads it gets, the better the computer will
play.

However, the number of threads should not exceed the number of processor cores
that your iPhone or iPad has. At best, too many threads will have no detrimental
effect, but it may also be that playing strength suffers because the computer
is taking up too much time switching between threads when instead it could make
better use of this time in a single thread of straightforward calculations.

Note that the iPhone 4S is the first iOS device that has a processor with 2
cores, so on older devices you should leave the number of threads set to 1. If
you don't know how many processor cores your device has, you can consult this
Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devices.

=========
Pondering
=========
This setting defines whether the computer is allowed to "think" while it is not
its turn. Turning this setting on allows the computer to play better because it
gets more time for its calculations.

Because the processor uses up more energy, this will affect your device's
battery life.

==============
Pondering time
==============
This setting defines how long the computer is allowed to "think" while it is not
its turn. In general, more pondering time means stronger play.

Pondering in general is already heavy on your device's battery, so obviously
increased pondering time will make the effect worse.

=============
Reuse subtree
=============
This setting defines whether the computer is allowed to "remember" some of the
results of its calculations from the last turn. Turning this setting off forces
the computer to forget the results of its calculations once it has made its
move. On its next move it will then need to re-calculate some of the very same
results that it has just forgotten. Turning this setting on therefore makes the
computer play stronger because it can use its allotted time for making new
calculations.

When "pondering" is turned on, "reuse subtree" must be turned on as well. The
app automatically does this for you, and it will also prevent you from
accidentally turning the setting off.

=============
Thinking time
=============
This setting defines how long the computer is allowed to "think" while it is
its turn. In general, more thinking time means stronger play.

The usual equation applies: More computing time = more energy usage = less
battery life. In addition, the thinking time setting also has an impact on the
user experience: Usually it is desirable that the computer player should not
take too long for its turn, and 10 seconds have been found to be a reasonable
default value.

=============
Maximum games
=============
This setting defines how many playout games the computer is allowed to calculate
before it must decide on a "best move". In general, the more playout games the
computer is allowed to calculate, the better it will play.

When it is the computer's turn, it will calculate until either its thinking time
has run out, or until the maximum number of calculated playout games has been
reached. Which one of the limits is reached first depends on how fast the
processor doing the calculations is.

More playout games usually means more time spent computing, which directly
translates into more energy used, hence lower battery life.

========================================
Limiting the computer's playing strength
========================================
The following thoughts might be helpful if you would like to tweak a profile to
limit the computer player's strength.

- Setting "maximum games" to very low values is guaranteed to cripple the
  computer player, regardless of your device CPU's number crunching power.
- Alternatively, you could also lower the value for "thinking time", but if you
  then use this profile on a new iPhone or iPad the computer player will
  probably become stronger because the new device has a faster processor, which
  means it can calculate more in the same amount of time.
- Assuming you chose "maximum games" as the limiting factor, you can simply
  raise its value to increase the computer's playing strength until you find the
  threshold that makes for challenging and engaging games.
- If you continue to raise the value for "maximum games", at a certain point
  "thinking time" will become the limiting factor because the CPU will not be
  able to calculate all of the playouts allowed by "maximum games" in the
  allotted time.
- Tampering with "thinking time" is something you will usually want to avoid,
  though, because you will have to wait longer for your opponent to do its
  thinking, which means that your user experience will suffer.
- The best two settings that further increase playing strength therefore are
  "reuse subtree" and pondering.

====================================
Predefined playing strength settings
====================================
This section lists the settings that the predefined playing strengths resolve
to.

- All playing strengths have the following settings in common: The default 10
  seconds of thinking time; a maximum memory of 32 MB; and a single thread. The
  "maximum memory" value is rather low because it must cater to the oldest iOS
  device still supported by the app. If you have a newer iPhone, or an iPad, you
  may wish to increase the value for maximum memory (and/or the thread count) if
  you feel that the profile is too weak for you.
- Playing strength 1 sets "maximum games" to 500.
- Playing strength 2 sets "maximum games" to 5000.
- Playing strength 3 sets "maximum games" to 10'000.
- Playing strengths 1-3 do not allow pondering, and they disable
  "reuse subtree".
- Playing strength 4 enables "reuse subtree" and removes the limit on
  "maximum games".
- Playing strength 5, in addition, enables pondering, with pondering time set to
  the default 5 minutes.

================
Resign threshold
================
This setting defines how quickly the computer will resign the game. The computer
player resigns if the quality of the best move it can find is below the resign
threshold. Lower thresholds make the computer less likely to resign. A threshold
of 0% guarantees that the computer will never resign.

Because the computer internally calculates percentages for the quality of its
moves, the resign threshold is also expressed in % so that the two values can
be compared to each other.

Each board size has its own resign threshold, because on larger boards the
computer engine making the calculations (Fuego) tends to generate slightly
higher values for "best move quality". The predefined resign behaviours
distinguish two board size ranges: 7x7 up to 13x13, and 15x15 up to 19x19.

==============================
Resign minimum number of games
==============================
This setting defines the minimum number of playout games that the computer must
calculate before it is allowed to use the resign threshold to make a decision
about resigning. The idea is that a low number of playout games is less likely
to result in high quality moves, thus the computer would resign much too
quickly when it would be allowed to decide on only a few playout games.

An important consideration for this setting is that the computer will
<em>never</em> resign if it has a value that is greater than the value of the
playing strength setting "Maximum games", because in that case the computer will
never calculate more than "Resign minimum number of games".

To prevent this from accidentally happening, "Resign minimum number of games" is
automatically calculated by default. This mechanism makes sure that whenever the
value for "Maximum games" changes, the value for
"Resign minimum number of games" is automatically adjusted to stay below
"Maximum games". Although you can disable this feature, it is recommended that
you leave auto-calculation turned on.

============================
Predefined resign behaviours
============================
This section lists the thresholds (in %) for each board size that the predefined
resign behaviours resolve to.

<pre>
&nbsp;                               Board size</br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scoring
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==================================
Area scoring and territory scoring
==================================
When you start a new game you can choose whether you want to play according to
area or territory scoring rules (sometimes also known as Chinese or Japanese
rules). Details about the two scoring systems can be found at
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Scoring. Because the scoring rules may affect decisions
how to play, you are not allowed to change the scoring rules in the middle of
the game.

The default scoring system is area scoring.

===============================
Why area scoring is the default
===============================
The reason why area scoring is the default is that the computer player (Fuego)
does not properly support territory scoring. This can be felt towards the end
game when the computer engine sometimes makes unnecessary moves:
- Under territory scoring rules, each stone placed inside your own territory is
  a lost point because it makes your territory smaller. Each stone placed into
  your opponent's territory is also a lost pint because it gives your opponent
  an additional prisoner.
- Under area scoring rules, both types of play are neutral: A stone placed
  inside your own territory makes your territory smaller, but it also gives you
  a point for the stone itself. A stone placed inside your opponent's territory
  is not relevant because under area scoring rules prisoners do not count.

The bottom line is that under territory scoring rules the computer player may
lose a game that it would have won under area scoring rules. In some cases the
computer player may even resign because its automated territory scoring
calculations are incorrect.

=====================
How to view the score
=====================
Whenever you want to view the current score, you tap the "Game info" button in
the toolbar above the game board, then you select the "Score" segment. The table
will display different entries depending on the scoring system that is in effect
for the current game.

If you view the score while the game is still in progress, you will notice that
some of the scoring table rows do not contain any numbers, and that the final
score therefore is not meaningful. The reason for this is that, unfortunately,
Little Go is not very smart about calculating the score - it relies quite
heavily on your help with evaluating which stones on the board are alive, which
ones are dead and which ones are in seki. To provide this help you have to
activate scoring mode.

==============================
How to activate scoring mode
==============================
To activate scoring mode, tap the "Game actions" button in the toolbar above the
game board, then select the "Score" item from the menu that pops up.

Scoring mode can be activated at any time during normal game play, and it will
activate automatically when the game ends after two consecutive pass moves.
Automatic activation can be turned off in the user preferences. Automatic
activation never happens if a player resigns, because in that situation the
other player automatically wins and the score is not relevant. If you want you
can manually activate Scoring mode even if a player resigned.

While scoring mode is active you cannot play moves or perform any other actions
that influence the game state (exceptions are loading a game from the archive,
or starting a new game). To leave scoring mode and return to normal game play
you can tap the toolbar button labelled "Done".

================
Territory markup
================
When scoring mode becomes active, Little Go (or better: Fuego in the background)
takes a moment while trying to find suggestions for an initial set of dead
stones. This feature is optional and can be turned off under
"Settings > Scoring > Find dead stones".

After the initial set of dead stones is determined, the board is divided up
into what Little Go thinks are black and white territories:
- Each color's territory is marked using a blackish or whitish translucent
  overlay
- Neutral territory is not marked at all
- "Inconsistent" territory (see further down) is marked with a red dot symbol.

===================
Marking dead stones
===================
You can now tap a stone to mark it (and its group) as being dead. Territory
coloring is immediately updated to display the new state. Note that the stones
you marked as being dead are displayed with a small red "x" in the center.
Stones marked as dead can be "unmarked" by tapping on them again, thus turning
them back to alive status.

Whenever you change the dead/alive state of one or more stones, the updated
total score is displayed in the toolbar above the game board. To view the
updated detail score you can display the "Game info" screen.

===================================
Assistance with marking dead stones
===================================
If you have a game with many small stone groups that are all dead, marking them
will quickly become tedious. You can get a bit of assistance by turning on an
option under "Settings > Scoring > Mark dead stones intelligently".

From now on, whenever you toggle the dead/alive status of a stone group, Little
Go will help you by automatically toggling adjacent stone groups of the same
color to the same dead/alive status.

======================
Marking stones in seki
======================
Tap the "Game actions" button in the toolbar above the game board, then select
the "Start marking as seki" item from the menu that pops up. From now on tapping
stones no longer marks them as dead or alive, instead it marks them as being in
seki. Stones in seki are displayed with a whitish rectangle. Stones marked as
being in seki can be "unmarked" by tapping on them again, thus turning them back
to alive status.

Revert to marking dead stones by tapping the "Game actions" button and selecting
the "Start marking as dead" item from the menu that pops up.

======================
Inconsistent territory
======================
If Little Go finds an empty territory where the state of adjacent dead or seki
stone groups is inconsistent, it will mark that territory in a special way (a
red dot symbol by default). The definition of "inconsistent" is:
- There are dead stone groups for both black and white
- There are both dead and alive stone groups of the same color
- There are both seki and non-seki stone groups in any color combination
  (effectively, seki stone groups must always be surrounded entirely by alive
  stone groups of the opposing color, except where they share neutral territory
  with other seki stone groups)

The reason for marking up inconsistent territory is to give you notice that a
stone group has probably been erroneously marked as dead, alive or in seki. Feel
free to ignore the markup if this is just a transient problem while you are
marking several stone groups and are on the way to a consistent state.

If you don't like the "red dot symbol" way to mark inconsistencies, you can
change the markup type under "Settings > Scoring > Inconsistent territory".
The option "neutral" causes inconsistent territories to be marked as if they
were neutral territories, in other words: not at all.

For the purpose of calculating the score, inconsistent territory always counts
as neutral territory. This is regardless of how inconsistencies are marked up.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preferences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the "Settings" tab you can set a number of user preferences that Little Go
will remember when the application is stopped and restarted.

This help section does not enumerate the different preferences, rather they are
explained in the appropriate context. For instance, all "Scoring" preferences
are explained in the "Scoring" help section.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The archive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=============
Saving a game
=============
When the Go board is visible, you can save the game that is currently in
progress by tapping the "Game actions" toolbar button and selecting the
"Save game" item from the menu that pops up. You must now specify a name, then
tap the "Done" toolbar button to actually save the game.

The default name for the saved game is always unique, i.e. there is no other
game saved under that name, so that you can quickly tap "Done" and be ready to
continue the game. If you accidentally type in a name that already exists you
will be warned and you can choose whether or not you want to overwrite the old
game.

================
Save game format
================

Little Go saves its games in text files that have the SGF format (SGF = Smart
Game Format) and the .sgf file extension.

====================
Managing the archive
====================
The "Archive" tab lists previously saved games, or games that were transferred
to the device via file sharing in iTunes or via import from an external
application (e.g. Mail). Tap the "Edit" toolbar button if you want to delete
one or more saved games. At the bottom of the screen (scroll down if you have
many saved games) there is a button that allows you to delete all saved games in
one fell swoop.

When you tap the entry for a saved game, a screen with detail info for that game
is displayed. You can rename the game by tapping on its name. To load the game
tap the "Load" toolbar button. To export the game file to an external
application (e.g. Mail, DropBox, or another Go application that can import .sgf
files) tap the "Actions" toolbar button.

====================
Loading a saved game
====================
When you view the details of a saved game on the "Archive" tab, you will find
in the toolbar a button labelled "Load". Tapping the button will initiate the
procedure to load the saved game, which overall is very similar to starting a
new game from scratch. The difference is that you cannot choose board size, Komi
or Handicap, as these parameters are part of the saved game.

======================
File sharing in iTunes
======================
You can transfer saved games to your computer via file sharing in iTunes:
1. Select the iOS device in iTunes
1. Activate the "Apps" tab
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page
1. Under the "File Sharing" section, you should see Little Go among the list
   of applications that support file sharing
1. Select Little Go to copy the saved games to your computer

Of course you can also do the transfer the other way round. When you upload an
.sgf file into Little Go, the file will not automatically show up in the list of
games on the "Archive" tab. Use one of the following workarounds to make the
file appear:
- Temporarily lock the screen of your iOS device, then unlock it again
- Switch to a different app, then switch back to Little Go
- Press the Home button of your iOS device, then re-activate Little Go

========================================================
Importing .sgf files from other applications (e.g. Mail)
========================================================
If you have an email message with an .sgf file attachment, you can open that
message in the Mail app on your device, then tap on the file attachment. Mail
will offer a selection of the applications that can process the file. You should
see Little Go among those applications; if you select Little Go the file will
be imported into Little Go's archive.

If you have other applications that are capable of exporting .sgf files (e.g.
DropBox) you should be able to import those files into Little Go in a similar
fashion as you did with Mail.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTP engine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

======================
Overview and a warning
======================
The computer player in Little Go is powered by the open source software library
Fuego (http://fuego.sourceforge.net/). Little Go and Fuego talk to each other
via GTP - the Go Text Protocol. In the GTP context, Fuego is called the GTP
engine, while Little Go is the GTP client.

On the "Diagnostics" tab you can observe the flow of communication between GTP
client and engine. You can even interfere with it by injecting your own GTP
commands. Be careful, though, not to disrupt normal operations: As the title
suggests, the "Diagnostics" tab options should only be used if something goes
wrong during normal game play and you need GTP to investigate the problem.

=======
GTP log
=======
The GTP log displays the last 100 GTP commands sent, and the responses received.
The log size can be changed under "Diagnostics > Settings > GTP log size".
Commands are listed in the order in which they were submitted, the most recent
command appears at the bottom of the log. The log is dynamically updated when a
new GTP command/response is submitted to or received from the GTP engine. The
log can be emptied under "Diagnostics > Settings > Clear GTP log".

Each log entry displays the name of the GTP command and the time when it was
sent to the GTP engine. Log entries are also color-coded to mark which type of
response was received by the GTP client: Green means a "success" response, red
means a "failure" response, and a gray question mark ("?") means that the GTP
client is still waiting for a response.

The "Flip" toolbar button can be used to switch between the table-oriented
view and the "raw" view of the GTP log.

The "new" toolbar button can be used to inject your own GTP command into the
communication flow between GTP client and engine. Tapping the button displays
a screen where you can enter a command using free-form text, or you can select
a command from a list of pre-defined commands. For more information about this
see further down.

=======================
Viewing a GTP log entry
=======================
When you tap an entry in the GTP log, a screen with detail information for that
entry is displayed. Most of the information you see here is already available in
the log itself. There is one more detail, though, and that is the detailed
response string. Most of the time the response to a GTP command just consists of
the success/failure status, but for some commands (e.g. "get_komi") the response
contains more information that is only available on this screen.

The "+" toolbar button lets you add the command to the list of pre-defined
commands. If there is no "+" button, the command is already pre-defined.

====================
Pre-defined commands
====================
On the "Diagnostics" tab you can select the entry "GTP commands" to view and
manage a list of pre-defined GTP commands. Usually these are often-used or
complicated commands that you do not want to re-type every time you need to
submit them. Commands are submitted in the "GTP log" screen.

The "Edit" toolbar button lets you delete and re-arrange commands, while the
"+" toolbar button allows you to add a new command to the list. Tapping an
entry in the list presents a detail screen where you can edit the command
string.

The application comes with a factory set of pre-defined commands which you can
freely edit. To discard your current set and return to the factory set, select
"Diagnostics > Settings > Reset predefined commands".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========
Overview
========
This help section contains only a barebones and purely textual introduction to
the rules of Go. Usually a few illustration are much more intelligible,
therefore I strongly suggest that to learn the rules you visit one of the many
websites dedicated to the game; my personal favourite is "Sensei's Library"
(http://senseis.xmp.net/).

=======
Players
=======
The game is played by two players. One of them plays with black stones, the
other with white stones. Usually black makes the first move, except when there
is a handicap. This introduction does not cover handicap.

=====
Board
=====
The board is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. The standard board size
is 19x19, but smaller board sizes are good for teaching games or solving special
Go problems. Little Go allows you to set any board size between 7x7 and 19x19.

=============
Intersections
=============
The lines of the board have intersections wherever they cross or touch each
other. Each intersection is called a point. That includes the four corners,
and the edges of the board. Stones are placed on points (intersections), which
might seem unusual if you are coming from chess.

=====
Moves
=====
Players take alternate turns. When it is their turn, they make a move. A move
usually consists of placing a stone. However, a player may also decide to pass,
in which case it is the other player's turn. If both players pass, the game
is over and the score is calculated to determine who has won the game.

Note that stones can only be placed on empty points. Also note that it is not
possible to move a stone once it has been placed.

=========
Liberties
=========
Each point (intersection) on the board has a number of lines leading away from
it to adjacent points. When a stone is placed on a point, the number of lines
leading away from it to unoccupied adjacent points are called its "liberties".

For instance, if a stone is placed in a corner at the start of the game it has 2
liberties, if it is placed on an edge line it has 3 liberties, and if it is
placed somewhere in the middle of the board it has 4 liberties.

Enemy stones that surround one of your stones take away liberties from that
stone. If your stone has no liberties left it is captured. The opponent removes
your stone from the board and places it in a box where at the end of the game
it can be used for scoring. The point where your stone was is now unoccupied
once more.

============
Stone groups
============
If you place stones next to each other so that they are connected through the
lines leading away from the points they occupy, they form a stone group. Stones
that are adjacent to each other diagonally are not connected through lines and
therefore do not form a stone group.

Stones in a group share their liberties. For instance, if you place a stone
somewhere in the middle of the board it initially has 4 liberties. If you now
place another stone on an adjacent point the two form a stone group and
together have 6 liberties.

Stones in a group must be captured as a group, i.e. the opponent must surround
the entire group and take away all their liberties before he can capture them.
If he succeeds, he captures the entire group and removes all stones from the
board.

============
Suicide rule
============
It is forbidden to place a stone so that it has no liberties. For instance, it
is forbidden to place a stone on a point that is surrounded on all sides by
enemy stones.

By extension, it is also forbidden to place a stone if it connects to a stone
group and the entire stone group would have no liberties left.

=========================
Exception to Suicide rule
=========================
The exception to the Suicide rule is: You are allowed to place a suicidal stone
if by placing it it takes away the last liberty of one or more enemy stones,
thus making liberties for its own.


=======================
No Repetition (ko) rule
=======================
It is forbidden to play a move which repeats a previous board position. This
rule prevents endless repetition in the face of alternating capturing moves due
to the exception to the Suicide rule.

Note that if some other moves are played in between, the same play may be
available again as a legal move, because it will not be repeating the same
board position.

This rule is also called the "ko" rule.

====
Life
====
Taking all the above rules into account, it is possible to form stone groups
that are impossible to capture under normal, alternating game play (also
assuming the defending player makes no mistakes). If such a group is formed it
is called "alive". A group that lives usually surrounds two or more separate
areas of empty points. These areas are called "eyes".

The concepts of "life" and "eyes" are not actually rules, they are just a
natural consequence of following the three rules about liberties, suicide and
ko. Nevertheless, it is essential to understand "life" and "eyes" to become
better at playing Go. Playing a few games, making mistakes and learning from
them usually is the best teacher.


===================
Purpose of the game
===================
The purpose of the game is to occupy or surround more points than the opponent.
When the game ends (both players pass), your score is calculated according to
the scoring system that you and your opponent agreed upon before the game
started.

For area scoring (the default in Little Go), calculate your score as follows:
- First, remove all dead stones from the board (your own, but also those of
  your opponent). Stones are dead if they are not "alive", i.e. if they could be
  captured if you were to continue playing. After removal, calculate your score
  as follows.
- The number of your stones on the board.
- Plus the number of empty only your stones surround.

Your opponent's score is calculated in the same way, only from his point of
view. Whoever plays white adds komi to his score (komi is usually 7½ and is
given to the white player as a bonus to compensate for the black player's
advantage of first move).

Whoever now has the higher score wins the game.

For territory scoring (the other major scoring system), calculate your score as
follows:
- The number of enemy stones that you captured during the game
- Plus the number of enemy dead stones on the board completely surrounded by
  your stones. See above for a short definition of when stones are dead.
- Plus the number of points completely surrounded by your stones, regardless of
  whether they are empty or occupied by enemy dead stones.
- Komi is usually 6½ for territory scoring

An important note about dead stones: You and your opponent must agree on which
stones are dead! If your opponent does not agree with your judgment, you must
continue the game until the situation in doubt has been settled to both players'
satisfaction. While you are new to the game you often will not see what the
final outcome of a situation in doubt will be, so you will spend a lot of time
in the end game on playouts. This is perfectly OK because you will learn from
the experience. Once you get more experienced, though, less situations will have
to be played out, making the end game less time consuming (and possible less
tedious for your more experienced opponent).

=========
Etiquette
=========
Some of the pleasure of playing Go (when played against a fellow human) comes
from following certain points of etiquette that have developed over the long
history and tradition of the game. In Little Go, most of the time you will play
against the computer, so there is not much point in going into the details of
this subject. If you are keen on reading more, though, I would like to refer you
once more to Sensei's Library (http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoEtiquette).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sending crash reports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Little Go crashes, data which can help the developer to correct the problem
will be collected automatically. All collected data is stored on your device,
nothing is sent without your permission. Next time you launch the app an alert
will be displayed, offering you the choice to send the collected data in the
form of a crash report to the developer. If you decline, no data is sent.

On the "Diagnostics" tab, you will find an entry that allows you to change
settings related to the crash reporting service. For instance, you can turn
off data collection entirely, or you can define an email address that should
be sent along with the crash data so that the developer will be able to contact
you if clarifications are needed about the problem. Have a look at the settings
page, it's all self-explanatory.

The crash report is a simple text file that contains the following information:
- Hardware model (not the device ID!)
- Operating system version
- Type of crash
- Technical information about the state of the application when the crash
  occurred


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporting bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=================
General procedure
=================
To report a bug, please send an email to mailto:herzbube@herzbube.ch that
contains a description of the problem and, if possible, step-by-step
instructions on how to reproduce it. I especially love the "how to reproduce"
part ☺ since this usually makes it much easier for me to pinpoint the source of
a problem.

===============================
The "Send a bug report" feature
===============================
For your convenience, on the "Diagnostics" tab you will find a button labelled
"Send a bug report". Tapping the button displays a pre-filled email view that
you only need to supplement with your problem description before you can send
off the report.

You will notice that the email has a file attached. The next section will tell
you more about this file.

============================
Diagnostics information file
============================
The file attached to the bug report email contains diagnostics information about
the current state of Little Go and the game in progress. This information helps
the developer to better diagnose problems that are hard to describe or
reproduce. If you ever find that Little Go behaves badly from time to time, but
not <em>all</em> the time, it will be most useful if you send a bug report (and
thus generate a diagnostics information file) right then and there when you
notice the problem. See the next section why you should also enable the
collecting of logging data before you send the bug report.

The "Diagnostics" tab also has a button that lets you just generate the
diagnostics information file, without sending an email. This can be useful if
your device is not capable of sending email, or if you just want to snapshot
the application behaving badly <em>now</em>, but send the bug report later.
Once you have generated the diagnostics information file, you can use iTunes
to transfer the file to your computer, and send the bug report from there. Read
"The archive" section of this manual for a quick overview of how iTunes file
sharing works.

==========================
Collecting logging data
==========================
On the "Diagnostics" tab, just above the bug reporting buttons, there is an
option that lets you enable the collecting of logging data. While this is
enabled, a log file is written in the background that captures technical details
about what you do with the app, which functions you execute, and what steps in
detail the app performs in response to your requests.

Sending a bug report without logging enabled is useful, but the diagnostics
information file that is attached to the report contains only a snapshot of the
state the application is in at the moment the report is generated. If you enable
logging, however, the diagnostic information file (which now includes the log
file) will document how the application came into its erroneous state. This is
a great help for reproducing a problem, especially when you yourself in your
bug report cannot describe exactly the steps to reproduce the problem.

<em><strong>For the log file to be useful, you must have logging enabled for
some time before you actually send the bug report.</strong></em> Ideally,
logging would be turned on from the moment when the application is launched, up
to the moment where you experience the bug and send the report.

Although it is such a useful thing, logging is disabled by default, mainly
because you may have privacy concerns. The secondary reason for disabling
logging by default is because it uses a few of your device's resources: The log
file may grow to a maximum size of 10 MB, and writing the file requires a few
write cycles of the solid state drive in your device.

================================================
What is inside the diagnostics information file?
================================================
The file is a .zip archive that contains the following pieces of information:
- A version number that identifies the format of the information inside the
  attachment
- iOS version and device type (only whether it is an iPhone or an iPad)
- A snapshot of some of Little Go's in-memory objects that make it possible to
  reproduce the state of Little Go exactly the way it was at the time the
  diagnostics information file was generated
- Your current preferences (including the players you have defined and the
  settings you use on GTP engine profiles)
- The current game as an .sgf file
- A screenshot of the "Play" tab (excluding the status bar, i.e. the name of
  your carrier is not in the screenshot)
- The output of the "showboard" GTP command
- The log file (if logging was previously enabled)

=============================================================
What is <em>not</em> inside the diagnostics information file?
=============================================================
The file does <em>not</em> contain any information that identifies you or your
device, nor any other information that comes from outside the Little Go app.

If you are concerned, please feel free to inspect the content of the file by
forwarding the email to your Mac or PC before you send the bug report to me. As
already mentioned further up, you can also transfer the file to your computer
via iTunes file sharing and inspect the file there.

Finally, since Little Go is open source you can also study the program code that
produces the file. Let me know and I will point you in the right direction.

=================================================
Diagnostics information file size and persistence
=================================================
The diagnostics information file's size varies with the current game's board
size, the number of moves made so far, your device's screen resolution, and
whether a log file is included or not. By far the largest part is the log file:
This can grow up to 10 MB, but since the diagnostics information file is .zip
compressed the end result is much smaller.

Without including the log file, the smallest diagnostics information file sizes
are between 50-90 KB (on a regular iPhone without Retina display), while the
largest files should not take up more than 200-300 KB (on an iPad with Retina
display).

For technical reasons, a copy of the file remains on your device after the bug
report email has been generated. The copy is located in the documents folder
within the Little Go app bundle where it is not accessible to any other apps -
even Little Go will not use the copy after the bug report has been sent. If you
generate another bug report, the lingering file from the previous bug report is
overwritten. If you want to get rid of the file you can do so via iTunes file
sharing.
