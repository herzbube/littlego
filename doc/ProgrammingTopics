Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document simply lists a number of iOS-related programming topics that I
studied while coding on this project, and where I found the information to
study each topic.


iOS topics covered in this project
----------------------------------
Little Go uses declared properties, some of them generated, others added
manually. Although declared properties are a language feature introduced to
Objective-C quite some time ago, this is still a new topic for me, which is why
I mention it here. Details can be found in [1].

The Fuego engine runs in a secondary thread, and communication with the engine
also occurs within a secondary thread. Basic understanding of how threading and
run loops work can be found in [2]. Scheduling with NSTimer is covered by [3].

Little Go is quite configurable and has a preference tab to manage all the
settings. This requires the "User Defaults" system (see [4]).

[5] explains the nib object lifecycle. This information is helpful for proper
cleanup during application shutdown. This document also contains information
on how to obtain references to resources embedded in the application bundle
(e.g. sound or image files).

Rendering a Go board in a UIView involves drawing with the Core Graphics and
UIKit frameworks. An introduction to drawing is provided by [6], more specific
information about drawing with Quartz is in [7].

User input is managed by the iOS event handling system. [8] describes how events
and touches are processed by the system on a fundamental level, and how, on a
higher level, gesture recognizer classes help with reacting to specific types
of user input.

[9] and [10] go into detail about the different types of views and view
controllers, and how they can be combined to make a nice and efficient UI. Worth
mentioning are the two sections of special interest that cover animations and
modal view controllers. Table views are such an important topic that an entire
guide [11] has been written about them. Last but not least, the section "iOS UI
Element Usage Guidelines" in [12] provides a useful all-in-one-page overview of
the UI elements and styles available in iOS.

Observing various model objects for user preferences changes can be elegantly
solved using the Key-Value Observing (KVO) technique, which in turn is based on
Key-Value Coding (KVC). The two concepts are extensively documented in [13] and
[14].

Playing short sounds and vibrating the iOS device are covered by [15], while
[16] has additional in-depth information on Audio processing. Playing a system
sound requires the use of Core Foundation data types; getting values from iOS
or Cocoa data types across the boundary into Core Foundation is sometimes as
simple as casting from one type to the other. [17] has details about this
so-called system of "Toll-Free Bridged Types".

[18] is a very good starting point for solutions to rather high-level problems.
Handling documents (including the sync to iTunes) is thoroughly explained in
the subsecion "Files and the File System".

Tasks that should run while the app is in the background are also explained in
[18], in section "Executing Code in the Background". To understand blocks,
which are required for background tasks, a side-trip to [19] and [20] should be
sufficient.

The finishing touch for an app before it is released to the App Store requires
a set of application icons, at least one launch image and an Info.plist file
with that is properly set up. Information on how to get these tasks done can be
found in section "App-Related Resources" of [18], in section "Custom Icon and
Image Creation Guidelines" of [12], and in [21].

Archiving an object graph to a file, and restoring the objects from such an
archive file, is explained in [22].

[23] shows how to use the NSPredicate class to represent logical expressions in
an object form, and how the clever use of predicates can make your code much
more expressive.

A handy feature of the Objective-C runtime is called "Associative references":
It allows to attach an object reference to another object under a certain name,
and to retrieve the referenced object at a later time, e.g. in a delegate
method. The required C functions are documented in [25].

[26] is Apple's must-read guide when you start working with scroll views for the
first time. I found this especially useful when it came to understand zooming.
[27] is also a nice companion tutorial.

An app that knows how to work with one or more document types (.sgf files in the
case of Little Go) should support Document Interaction so that files of a given
type can be passed to the app from another app. The concept and how to implement
support for it is explained in [28]. The Info.plist key CFBundleDocumentTypes
is documented in [21]. Information about Uniform Type Identifiers (UTI) can be
found in [29] and [30], while [31] lists the System-Declared Uniform Type
Identifiers.
