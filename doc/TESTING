Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document has information about how the project's automated testing
facilities work. It also contains a script for manual testing of most of the
application's features. The intent is to execute the script before a new
version is released to the App Store.


Automated unit tests
--------------------
All unit test related files are located in the top-level folder "test".

The Xcode project defines a target "Unit tests" which builds a unit test bundle.
To make the unit tests build automatically every time the main target is built,
I usually make sure that in all of my Xcode schemes the checkbox "Run" is
checked not only for the main target, but for the unit test target as well.
Note that the same result can also be achieved by a target dependency.

To run the tests, you must manually select the "Product > Test" menu item. It
would be preferrable to run the tests automatically as part of the build, but I
am not aware how this can be achieved in Xcode 5 or later. In Xcode 4.x there
was a built-in script named "RunUnitTests" that could be invoked in a
"Run Script" build phase. In Xcode 5, however, this is no longer working, the
built-in script fails with the error message "RunUnitTests is obsolete."

See NOTES.Build for technical details about the "Unit test" build target.

A final note about logging: The log file for unit tests run in the simulator
environment is located in
~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/Logs.


Automated UI tests
------------------
There are currently no automated UI tests for this project. An attempt was made
to implement such tests using the cross-platform test automation framework
Appium [1], but the attempt was aborted because there was simply too much to do
in the limited amount of time that I am willing to spend on this project.

Script for manual testing
-------------------------
The device name "iPhone n+" refers to any of the superior iPhone devices which
have a larger screen than regular iPhones. The first of these devices was the
iPhone 6+, later models are iPhone 6s+, iPhone 7+, etc.

Preconditions
- Perform tests on a real device, not in the simulator
- Before testing begins, remove the app bundle from the device under test so
  that all preferences and saved games from previous tests are erased
- Create a build with the "Distribute_AdHoc" configuration and install that
  build on the device
  - Via Xcode, if the device can be physically connected to the build machine.
    Disconnect the device after the build has been installed so that the tests
    are performed without Xcode being attached to the process.
  - Via ad-hoc distribution if the above is not possible. In this case, the
    device UUID must be added to the ad-hoc distribution provisioning profile
    and the provisioning profile must be installed on the device before the test
    build can be installed.
- Unless otherwise noted, tests on devices that support landscape orientation
  (iPad, iPhone n+) should be made with the device held in landscape orientation


Basic functionality to switch between UI areas of the application
- Launch application
- Briefly activate all UI areas of the application
- In the Settings area check that all user preferences use factory default
  settings

- Swipe from right to left [test does not make sense until issue 238 is
  resolved]
- The board scrolls
- Rotate the device to landscape
- Scroll to the top, then to the bottom of the list of board positions to make
  sure that the first and last board positions are visible
- Rotate the device to portrait
- Tap the "Moves" button
- Rotate the device to landscape
- Scroll to the top, then to the bottom of the list of board positions to make
  sure that the first and last board positions are visible
- Scroll the board to make sure that the scroll gesture is recognized


iPhone n+ layout
- Launch app in portrait
- The UI differs from the UI of smaller iPhones like this:
  - The toolbar at the top of the screen contains a "Menu" button on the right
  - Below the game board are the following elements, arranged from top to
    bottom:
    - A button box that contains the board position navigation buttons
    - A list with board positions that is horizontally scrollable
    - The status view
- Tap the "Menu" button. The main menu view appears that lists all the UI areas
  of the app. The main menu view has a title bar with a title "Main Menu" and a
  back button "Play".
- Check that each UI area can be activated, and that it is possible to return
  from each UI area to the list of UI areas.
- Dismiss the main menu
- Rotate the device to landscape
- The UI differs from the UI of smaller iPhones like this:
  - On the left-hand side of the screen is a list with board positions that is
    vertically scrollable
  - Below the list with board positions is the status view
  - On the left and right of the game board are two button boxes
    - On the left: A button box that contains the board position navigation
      buttons
    - On the right: A button box that contains the toolbar buttons, with two
      permanent buttons (Game Info, More Game Actions) at the bottom, and above
      all the remaining buttons
  - The "Menu" button is in the top-right corner of the screen
- Tap the "Menu" button. The main menu view appears that lists all the UI areas
  of the app. The main menu view has a title bar with a title "Main Menu" and a
  back button "Play".
- Check that each UI area can be activated, and that it is possible to return
  from each UI area to the list of UI areas.
- Make sure that you are viewing the list of UI areas
- Rotate the device to portrait. The list of UI areas rotates correctly.
- Dismiss the main menu. The Play UI area is shown with the layout for portrait.
  It is acceptable if the transition from landscape to portrait layout is
  briefly visible.
- Tap the "Menu" button, rotate the device to landscape, then dismiss the main
  menu. The Play UI area is shown with the layout for landscape. Again, it's
  acceptable if the UI update is briefly visible.
- iOS 7 only
  - Tap the "Menu" button
  - Start a drag gesture by dragging from the left edge of the screen towards
    the right. The Play UI area gradually becomes visible the farther you drag.
  - Cancel the gesture by lifting the finger before more than half of the screen
    is covered by the Play UI area. The main menu view slides back into place.
    The title bar with the view title and the back button (which were temporarily
    hidden during the drag gesture) are visible again.
- iOS 8 and newer
  - Tap the "Menu" button
  - Try to start a drag gesture by dragging from the left edge of the screen
    towards the right. The gesture has no effect.


Tab functionality (on those devices that use a tab bar)
- Dismissing "Game info" view
  - Go to Play area
  - Tap the "Game info" button
  - Tap the "Play" tab bar button. This must dismiss the "Game info" view, just
    as if the "back" button had been tapped


Special test cases
- Disable UI rotation while stone is being placed
  - This test is possible only on a device where the app supports UI rotation
  - Start a gesture to place a stone
  - Rotate the device while the gesture is still in progress
  - The UI must not rotate
  - End the stone placing gesture
  - Rotate the device
  - The UI must rotate


Board setup and player setup tests
- The following table lists a set of .sgf files that are used to test the app's
  behaviour in regard to various board setup and player setup combinations.
- The table lists the basic characteristics of each file, together with the
  file's specific test goals.
- The entire set of .sgf file also fulfills combinatorial test goals. For
  instance, board setup must work regardless of whether or not moves are
  present in the file, or whether player setup is also present in the file.
  Usually these combinatorial test goals are not explicitly mentioned.


File      Board   Player
name      setup   setup    Handicap   Moves   Test goals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02*.sgf   -       -        -          x       Test absence of player and board setup properties.
03*.sgf   -       x        x          x       1) Test regular handicap: The black stone setup property which exists in the same
                                                 node as the handicap property enumerates the handicap stones.
                                              2) Test that player setup works if the player setup property appears in the same
                                                 node as the handicap property. Test that the white player can be set up in
                                                 accordance to the game rules (white plays first when handicap is present).
04*.sgf   x       x        x          x       1) Test mix of setup and handicap: The black stone setup property which exists in
                                                 the same node as the handicap property enumerates BOTH handicap stones and
                                                 additional setup stones, but the end result is that all those black stones are
                                                 interpreted as handicap stones. The same node also contains a white stone setup
                                                 property, these white stones are treated as regular setup stones.
                                              2) The numeric handicap values in the HA property does not match the number of
                                                 handicap stones enumerated by the black stone setup property. This is currently
                                                 accepted, but might be rejected in the future.
05*.sgf   x       x        -          x       1) Test regular black/white stone setup without handicap.
                                              2) Test that the black player can be set up. Test that this works if the first
                                                 move is actually by black.
06*.sgf   x       x        x          x       1) Test setup and handicap in separate nodes. Unlike in 04*.sgf, if the black stone
                                                 setup property is in a different node than the HA property, this results in
                                                 genuine black setup stones.
                                              2) Test that a different player can be setup than the player who actually makes
                                                 the first move. Load the .sgf file, then go the initial board position. The
                                                 first move must be shown as by white, even though the black player is set up
                                                 to move first. Discard all moves then play a move - now the black player plays
                                                 first in accordance with the player setup.
07*.sgf   x       x        x          x       Tests the same things as 06*.sgf, albeit with different data. The difference is
                                              that this file was saved by Fuego, whereas 06*.sgf was manually crafted. The
                                              difference is a bit artificial.
08*.sgf   x       -        -          x       Test that board setup properties in multiple nodes are aggregated.
09*.sgf   x       -        -          -       Same as 08*.sgf, but without moves.
10*.sgf   x       x        x          -       Test what happens if board setup properties in later nodes "overwrite" intersections
                                              already occupied by handicap stones. In this case, the .sgf file is illegal because a
                                              white setup stone is placed on intersection K4 which is already occupied by a handicap
                                              stone.
11*.sgf   x       x        x          -       1) Test what happens if board setup properties in later nodes "overwrite" intersections
                                                 already occupied by handicap stones. In this case, the .sgf file is legal because a
                                                 black setup stone is placed on intersection D4 which is already occupied by a handicap
                                                 stone. The result is that the black setup stone is ignored and intersection D4 is
                                                 treated as handicap stone.
                                              2) Test that multiple player setup properties can appear in the .sgf file and that the
                                                 last one wins. Load the .sgf file then play a move - the black player must move first.
12*.sgf   x       x        x          x       1) Same board setup as 11*.sgf, but with moves.
                                              2) Player setup properties are slightly different than in 11*.sgf. The white player
                                                 plays first, and it's the same player who actually makes the first  move.
13*.sgf   -       x        -          x       Test that a different player can be setup than the player who actually makes the first
                                              move. This is the same test as in 06*.sgf, but this time without any board setup nor
                                              handicap present.
14*.sgf   x       x        x          -       Same board setup as 11*.sgf, but with only a single player setup property located in
                                              the node of the handicap property. After loading the file white must play first. It
                                              seems as if this file is somewhat superfluous.
15*.sgf   x       x        x          -       Test what happens if board setup properties in later nodes "overwrite" intersections
                                              already occupied by previous setup stones. This is always legal: Intersection A1
                                              ends up with a white stone (overwriting a previously set up black stone), and
                                              intersection T19 ends up with a black stone (overwriting a previously set up white stone).
16*.sgf   x       -        -          -       Test that a board setup that places stones with 0 liberties is illegal. In this test the
                                              white stones have 0 liberties. The .sgf file is illegal.
17*.sgf   x       -        -          -       Same as 16*.sgf, but in this test the black stones have 0 liberties. The .sgf file is
                                              illegal.
18*.sgf   x       x        -          x       Test that a board setup can contribute to a positional superko. The .sgf file is illegal
                                              when loaded with positional superko rules. The .sgf file is legal when loaded with
                                              simple ko or situation superko rules.
19*.sgf   x       x        -          x       Test that a board setup can contribute to a situational superko. The .sgf file is illegal
                                              when loaded with situational and also positional superko rules. The .sgf file is legal
                                              when loaded with simple ko rules.
20*.sgf   -       -        x          -       Test that if handicap is present but no explicit player setup, the game rules ensure
                                              that white plays first. After loading the .sgf, make sure that white plays first.
                                              This test is especially interesting because Fuego always writes a player setup property
                                              to the .sgf file if handicap is present.

To create the files for the above tests, copy & paste the following lines into
a shell script, then run that shell script.
