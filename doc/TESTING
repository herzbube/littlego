Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document has information about how the project's automated testing
facilities work. It also contains a script for manual testing of most of the
application's features. The intent is to execute the script before a new
version is released to the App Store.


Automated Unit tests
--------------------
All unit test related files are located in the top-level folder "test".

The Xcode project defines a target "Unit tests" which builds a unit test bundle.
To make the unit tests build automatically every time the main target is built,
I usually make sure that in all of my Xcode schemes the checkbox "Run" is
checked not only for the main target, but for the unit test target as well.
Note that the same result can also be achieved by a target dependency.

To run the tests, you must manually select the "Product > Test" menu item. It
would be preferrable to run the tests automatically as part of the build, but I
am not aware how this can be achieved in Xcode 5. In Xcode 4.x there was a
built-in script named "RunUnitTests" that could be invoked in a "Run Script"
build phase. In Xcode 5, however, this is no longer working, the built-in script
fails with the error message "RunUnitTests is obsolete."

Notes about the "Unit test" target:
- All tests in this target are what Apple used to call "logic tests", i.e. unit
  tests exercise more or less isolated classes. The test source code is built
  using the iOS Simulator SDK, and tests can be run within the simulator only,
  i.e. not on a real iOS device, and also not outside of the simulator (the
  latter differs from Xcode 4.x where it was possible to run tests without
  launching the simulator)
- All source code files that are unit tested must be added to the "Unit test"
  target so that they are built for that target.
- The build setting "Header Search Path" is set to the value "./src". Since the
  test sources are completely separated from the normal application sources, I
  don't want to deal with relative path issues for each #import statement. The
  application can be seen as third party software from the point of view of the
  unit test bundle.
- Because application source files depend on the presence of a prefix header,
  the "Unit test" target has to have the same "Prefix header" build settings
  as the main application target.
- Compiling ApplicationDelegate usually pulls in Fuego/Boost (via GTP classes)
  as dependencies. To prevent this, the "Unit test" target defines the
  preprocessor macro LITTLEGO_UNITTESTS. The effect is that certain #include
  statements and pieces of code are not compiled and the dependency on
  Fuego/Boost goes away.

A final note about logging: The log file for unit tests run in the simulator
environment is located in
~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/Logs.


Automated UI tests
------------------
There are currently no automated UI tests for this project. An attempt was made
to implement such tests using the cross-platform test automation framework
Appium [1], but the attempt was aborted because there was simply too much to do
in the limited amount of time that I am willing to spend on this project.

Script for manual testing
-------------------------
Preconditions
- Perform tests on a real device, not in the simulator
- Remove the app bundle from the device under test so that all preferences and
  saved games are erased
- Create a build with the "Distribute_AdHoc" configuration and install that
  build on the device via ad-hoc distribution
- Perform tests while not connected to Xcode


Basic tab functionality
- Launch application
- Briefly activate all tabs
- On the settings tab check that all user preferences use factory default
  settings
- On the archive tab check that no saved games are present
- On the diagnostics tab check that the GTP log contains no failed commands
- On the "More" tab, go through all the documents once and check that they
  are properly displayed


Basic game play functionality
- Switch back to the play tab
- The navigation bar at the top displays the following buttons
  - Computer play
  - Pass
  - Game Info
  - Game Actions
- All buttons are enabled
- Tap the "game info" button
- The "Game Info" view slides into view, covering the entire content of the
  play tab
  - The navgation bar contains a "back" button and a segmented control with the
    following segments: Score, Game, Board
  - The Score segment is selected
- Select the "Game" segment. Check that the information presented matches the
  factory defaults: No handicap, board size 9, komi 7.5, simple ko rule, area
  scoring, black player is "Anonymous", white player is "Fuego".
- Tap "back" to dismiss the "Game Info" view; the view slides away to once more
  reveal the game board and other UI elements of the play tab
- Touch the screen & keep touching
- The stone must appear immediately.
  - iPhone: The stone must appear some distance above the fingertip location
  - iPad: The stone must appear directly under the fingertip
- Drag the cross-hair around the board: The status view must continuously be
  updated to show the coordinates of the current position
- Move the stone outside of the board area, then release the finger: No stone
  must be placed
- Place a stone. The computer player must immediately respond with a move, i.e.
  without a "computer is thinking" delay. This indicates that the opening book
  is present.
- In the Play view settings, set the move numbers slider to its lowest value,
  then switch back to the Play tab
- The white stone is marked with the symbol for the last stone that was placed
- The "discard" button has now become visible
- Tap the "computer play" button. The computer must generate a move on behalf of
  black, then respond with its own move for white.
- Tap the "Pass" button. No black stone must be placed, the computer must
  respond with a move for white
- Display the "Game Info" view. The "Game" segment must already be selected.
  The "game state" section must display updated information. Dismiss the
  "Game Info" view.
- Tap the "Discard" button repeatedly until no stones are left on the board
- Each discard must remove one move
- When all moves have been discarded, the "discard" button must no longer be
  visible

  computer will start to take longer for calculating moves. The status view
  must display two distinct messages: "Computer is playing for <player name>"
  and "<player name> is thinking".
- Tap the "computer play" button. While the computer is thinking the regular
  buttons are replaced by the "interrupt" button
- Tap the "interrupt" button. The computer immediately stops thinking and plays
  a move.
- Tap the "action" button. A menu must appear that displays the following
  buttons: Score, Resign, Save game and New game. On the iPhone there is also
  a Cancel button.
- Tap cancel (iPhone) or tap outside of the menu area (iPad). The menu must be
  dismissed without any action taking place.


Illegal play
- Create a situation that allows you to try to play each of the following
  illegal moves
  - Suicide
  - Ko
  - Any one of the two superko situations (positional is easier to create).
    For this you need to restart the game with a superko rule.

- Mute the device, then let the computer player make a move
- There must be no audio feedback, only a vibration feedback
- Turn off vibration in the system preferences, then let the computer player
  make a move
- There must be neither audio nor vibration feedback
- Turn the device settings back to normal so that vibration is on and the device
  is not muted. This is important for subsequent tests.
- Tap "computer play"
- There must be neither audio nor vibration feedback when the computer generates
  the move on behalf of the player.
- Wait until the computer has generated its own move. Now there must be both
  audio and vibration feedback.


Save game
- Tap the "action" button, then select "save game"
- A modal screen must pop up that lets the user enter a name for the saved game
