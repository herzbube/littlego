          <p>Little Go is a free and open source iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone or iPad. You can play against another human (on the same device), or against the computer. The computer player is powered by the open source software library <a href="http://fuego.sf.net/">Fuego</a>. The minimum requirement for running the most recent version of Little Go is iOS 15.0.</p>

<p>For more information about Little Go's features have a look at its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-go/id490753989?ls=1">App Store page</a>. A user manual is <a href="https://littlego-usermanual.herzbube.ch/">available online</a> as well as in the "Help" UI area when you launch the app.</p>

<p>Little Go is released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License</a> (2.0).</p>

<p>You can read the privacy policy for Little Go <a href="privacy.html">on a separate page</a>.</p>

<h3>Your contribution</h3>

<p>Little Go is an open source project and welcomes your contribution. Are you a developer? Code the next cool feature that you won't get from me. Would you like to help with beta-testing, creating an app video preview or a website design? Let me know and I will get back to you before the next release is due. Have you found a bug? Don't hesitate to submit a report.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to have a look at the "Credits" tab inside the app. It always lets me appreciate anew how many people already have helped with the making of Little Go. A big "Thank You!" to all of you!</p>

<h3>Developers</h3>

<p>If you are interested in Little Go as a developer, you can either clone the GitHub source code repository (follow the link "View on GitHub" at the top of this page) or download the latest release snapshot of the source code (use one of the download links at the top of this page). Once you have the source code you should start by reading the file <code>doc/README.developer</code> - the quick-start guide at the top of the file should get you up and running with a minimum amount of hassle.</p>

<h3>Beta-testers</h3>

<p>If you are interested you are welcome to play around with a new release of Little Go before it gets to the App Store. Please <a href="mailto:herzbube@herzbube.ch">contact me</a> for details.</p>

<h3>How to report bugs or ask questions</h3>

<p>The official bug tracker is <a href="https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/issues">on GitHub</a>. GitHub also has an <a href="https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/discussions">area for discussions</a> where you can ask questions. To submit a new issue, or to participate in a discussion, you must be a registered GitHub user (it's free and they won't bother you with spam!).</p>

<p>Little Go also has a built-in bug report feature which lets you send an email with an attachment that contains diagnostics information. For the best result, I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you first enable logging (also on the "Diagnostics" tab), then reproduce the bug, then finally submit the bug report. Also important: Write at least a short description of the problem, don't assume that I will be able to divine your problem just from the diagnostics information file. Without a problem description I will most probably just ignore your message!</p>

<p>Last but not least, you can also <a href="mailto:herzbube@herzbube.ch">email me directly</a>.</p>

<li>The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-go/id490753989?ls=1">App Store page</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/littlego">This Open Hub page</a> provides mildly interesting source code statistics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project state</h3>

<p>Several years of development have gone into Little Go since its inception in January 2011. The app now has a feature set that is, I believe, quite nice â˜º for a free program. My main focus will therefore lie on fixing any remaining bugs (of which I am sure there are plenty) and keeping the app running under future versions of iOS.</p>
